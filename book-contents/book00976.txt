Let's Talk It Over 



A S WE go to press, the first 
issue of GALAXY Science 
L Fiction has been on sale 
three weeks, yet newsstands report 
sellouts, and mail response has 
been enormous in volume and en- 
couragement. Each suggestion has 
been carefully examined and, even 
at this early date, reader prefer- 
ences are beginning to assume 
clear outline: 

• Cover design and format are 
approved. There were some re- 
quests to remove the bottom band, 
where the story or author lineup is 
given, but this would mean sur- 
prising on the painting. See next 
issue before voting. 

• Cover treatment will have to 
wait until the results of our second 
and third cover experiments are 
evaluated. The first (done in ana- 
line, by the way, not pastel, as 
some seemed to think) deliberate- 
ly subordinated the figures to the 
harsh landscape, a technique used 
by Utrillo and other great artists 
of our time. Sibley, who did the 
second cover, used the opposite ap- 
proach. The present one, by Hunt- 
er, again is an artist’s solution, 
which would, of course, have been 
handled differently as illustration. 
We won’t stop evolving. Tabled. 
• One lone and evidently lonely 
man asked for nudes. Outvoted. 

• Interior art has to be regarded 



on the basis of several issues. Stone 
and Calle have been called back 
into service, which effectively re- 
moves them from the argument. 
Back to committee. 

• The vote thus far is vastly in 
favor of serials; any turnout of the 
opposition will have to be more 
than a lobby. Passed. 

• Not enough have indicated ap- 
proval of three installments of 
serials. Referred to constituents. 

• Some authors plumped for story 
rating; readers in general gave no 
opinion. My feeling is that ratings 
overlook the need for editorial bal- 
ance — light shorts to balance 
grimmer novelets, for example, or 
the other way around. But it's not 
too much trouble to rate stories if 
you want it. Tabled. 

• Sentiment is unclear on articles. 
We are skipping one in the next 
issue to sample the reaction. 

• Using author’s names at the end 
of their stories created an odd sit- 
uation. Some objected without ex- 
plaining why. Others liked not 
having to look up the author’s 
name, either on the contents page 
or story opening. One reader 
thought it was somehow very 
clever. None of this was in my 
-ynind when I happened on the de- 
vice; I just wanted to indicate The 
End without using those coldly 
final words, though I did realize it

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



would make identification of the 
authors easier. Other editors seem 
very willing to borrow it. Should 
we give it up by default? Referen- 
dum. 

• GALAXY'S Five Star Shelf has 
been cheered by those who men- 
tion it, rather a large number. 
Passed. 

• Not a single person has argued 
against editorials, which is a big 
shock for me. I personally ques- 
tion their value in a fiction maga- 
zine and have used these pages 
only to fashion GALAXY Science 
Fiction in the shape you desire. But 
when that’s done, what then? Do 
I borrow a lab smock and articles 
from science journals? Appeal to 
voters. 

• Final and most startling point is 
the letter department. There is evi- 
dently a greater reader dislike of 
mail columns than I had sensed. 
The objection, in fact, was so 
vociferous that I am hastily putting 
off action until more counties have 
a chance to be heard. The brief 
states that the space would be more 
gainfully employed for fiction. It’s 
a point . but is it shared by the 
majority? Standing vote. 

T HE bulk of subscriptions, and 
it can really be spoken of as 
bulk, was for both GALAXY 
Science Fiction and GALAXY 
Science Fiction Novels, showing 
decided interest in old as well as 
new stories. "The Legion of Space” 
by Jack Williamson is the current 



selection for reprint, but future 
titles have not been chosen at this 
writing. What books would you 
like to see reprinted? None, by the 
way, will be reprints of books that 
have already appeared at 25£. 

Speaking of subscriptions, we 
have a rather gigantic offer for 
Christmas. For this purpose, two 
ads have been placed back to back, 
so that the coupons can be clipped 
without mutilating the book. But 
those purists and collectors who 
wouldn’t cut out even a deliberate- 
ly arranged page can send in any 
kind of order sheet. The coupons 
are there for your convenience, not 
ours. Use anything, but subscribe 
. and take the opportunity to in- 
troduce others to your favorite 
type of fiction at this really gen- 
erous saving. 

You might note also that we 
have a limited number of Volume 
I Numbers 1 and 2. You can either 
buy them singly or start subscrip- 
tions with them. They’re real col- 
lector’s items. Better than stamps; 
at least you have something to read. 

Not at all incidentally, we have 
raised our word rates to the high- 
est in science fiction. If any authors 
have missed that announcement 
through writers’ magazines and 
agents, this should serve as notice. 
We want the best and are prepared 
to pay for it. 

How do we do it? By aiming 
for. the biggest audience of any 
science fiction magazine . with 
your help. — H. L. GOLD 



LET'S TALK IT OVER

Second 



Throwing a person to the wolves to save 
the rest is never a pleasant solution. 
In this case it was an entire world! 



O N THE night after the day 
that brought summer offi- 
cially to the land of Wend, 
on the planet of Noorhut, the shin- 
ing lights were seen again in the 
big hollow at the east end of 
Grimp's father’s farm. 

Grimp watched them for more 
than an hour from his upstairs 
room. The house was dark, but an 
occasional murmur of voices floated 
up to him through the windows be- 
low. Everyone in the farmhouse was 
looking at the lights. 



On the other farms around and 
in the village, which was over a hill 
and another two miles up the val- 
ley, every living soul who could get 
within view of the hollow was 
probably doing the same. For a 
time, the agitated yelling of the Vil- 
lage Guardian’s big pank-hound 
had sounded clearly over the hill, 
but he had quieted down then very 
suddenly — or had been quieted 
down, more likely, Grimp suspect- 
ed. The Guardian was dead-set 
against anyone making a fuss about

SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER

the lights — and that included the 
pank-hound, too. 

There was some excuse for the 
pank-hound's excitement, though. 
From the window, Grimp could see 
there were a lot more lights tonight 
than had turned up in previous 
years — big, brilliant-blue bubbles, 
drifting and rising and falling si- 
lently all about the hollow. Some- 
times one would lift straight up for 
several hundred feet, or move off 
over the edge of the hollow for 
about the same distance, and hang 
there suspended for a few minutes, 
before floating back to the others. 
That was as far as they ever went 
away from the hollow. 

There was, in fact, no need for 
the Halpa detector-globes to go any 
farther than that to get the infor- 
mation wanted by those who had 
sent them out, and who were listen- 
ing now to the steady flow of brief 
reports, in some Halpa equivalent 
of human speech-thought, coming 
back to them through the globes: 

"No signs of hostile activity in 
the vicinity of the breakthrough 
point. No weapons or engines of 
power within range of detection. 
The area shows no significant al- 
terations since the last investigation. 
Sharp curiosity among those who 
observe us consciously — traces of 
alarm and suspicion. But no overt 
hostility.” 

The reports streamed on without^ 
interruption, repeating the same 
bits of information automatically 
and incessantly, while the globes 



floated and dipped soundlessly 
above and about the hollow. 

Grimp. continued to watch them, 
blinking sleepily now and then, un- 
til a spreading glow over the edge 
of the valley announced that Noor- 
hut’s Big Moon was coming up 
slowly, like a Planetary Guardian, 
to make its own inspection of the 
lights. The globes began to dim 
out then, just as they always had 
done at moonrise in the preceding 
summers; and even before the top 
rim of the Big Moon’s yellow disk 
edged over the hills, the hollow 
was completely dark. 

Grimp heard his mother starting 
up the stairs. He got hurriedly into 
bed. The show was over for the 
night and he had a lot of pleasant 
things to think about before he 
went to sleep. 

Now that the lights had showed 
up, his good friend Grandma Erisa 
Wannattel and her patent-medicine 
trailer were sure to arrive, too. 
Sometime late tomorrow afternoon, 
the big draft-trailer would come 
rolling up the valley road from the 
city. For that was what Grandma 
Wannattel had done the past four 
summers — ever since the lights first 
started appearing above the hollow 
for the few nights they were to be 
seen there each year. And since four 
years were exactly half of Grimp’s 
whole life, that made Grandma's 
return a mathematical certainty for 
Mm. 

Other people, of course, like the 
Village Guardian, might have a 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



poor opinion of Grandma, but just 
hanging around her and the trailer 
and the gigantic, exotic-looking 
rhinocerine pony that pulled it was, 
in Grinip’s opinion, a lot better 
even than going to the circus. 

And vacations started the day 
after tomorrow! The whole future 
just now, in fact, looked like one 
good thing after another, extending 
through a vista of summery in- 
finities. 

Grimp-went to sleep happily. 

A T ABOUT the same hour, 
though at a distance greater 
than Grimp’s imagination had 
stretched as yet, eight large ships 
came individually out of the dark- 
ness between the stars that was their 
sea, and began to move about Noor- 
hut in a carefully timed pattern of 
orbits. They stayed much too far 
out to permit any instrument of 
space-detection to suspect that 
Noorhut might be their common 
center of interest.. 

But that was what it was. 
Though the men who crewed -the 
eight ships bore the people of 
Noorhut no ill will, hardly any- 
thing could have looked less 
promising for Noorhut than the 
cargo they had on board. 

Seven of them were armed with 
a gas which was not often use.d 
any more. A highly volatile lethal 
catalyst, it sank to the solid surface 
of a world over which it was freed 
and spread out swiftly there to the 
point where its presence could no 



longer be detected by any chemical 
means. However, its effect of draw- 
ing the final breath almost imper- 
ceptibly out of all things that were 
oxygen-breathing was not notice- 
ably reduced by diffusion. 

The eighth ship was equipped 
with a brace of torpedoes, which 
were normally released some hours 
after the gas-carriers dispersed their 
invisible death. They were quite 
small torpedoes, since the only task 
remaining for them would be to 
ignite the surface of the planet that 
had been treated with the catalyst. 

All those things might presently 
happen to Noorhut. But they would 
happen only if a specific message 
was flashed from it to the circling 
squadron — the message that Noor- 
hut already was lost to a deadly foe 
who must, at any cost now, be pre- 
vented from spreading out from it 
to other inhabited worlds. 

N EXT afternoon, right after 
school, as Grimp came ex- 
pectantly around the bend of the 
road at the edge of the farm, he 
found the village policeman sitting 
there on a rock, gazing tearfully 
down the road. 

"Hello, Runny,” said Grimp,. 
disturbed. Considered in the light 
of gossip he’d overhead in the vil- 
lage that morning, this didn’t look 
so good for Grandma. It just didn’t 
look good. 

The policeman blew his nose on 
a handkerchief he carried tucked 
into the front of his uniform. 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



7 . 



wiped his eyes, and gave Grimp an 
annoyed glance. 

"Don’t you' call me Runny, 
Grimp!” he said, replacing the 
handkerchief. Like Grimp himself 
and most of the people on Noor- 
hut, the policeman was brown- 
skinned and dark-eyed, normally 
a rather good-looking young fel- 
low. But his eyes were swollen and 
red-rimmed now; and his nose, 
which was a bit larger than aver- 
age, anyway, was also red and 
swollen and undeniably runny. He 
had hay-fever. 

Grimp apologized and sat down 
thoughtfully on the rock beside the 
policeman, who was one of his 
numerous cousins, most of the 
families of Noorhut being some- 
how related. He was about to men- 
tion that he had overheard Vellit 
using the expression when she and 
the policeman came through the 
big Leeth-flower orchard above the 
farm the other evening — at a much 
less leisurely rate than was their 
custom there. But he thought bet- 
ter of it. Vellit was the policeman’s 
girl for most of the year, but she 
broke their engagement regularly 
during hay-fever season and called 
him cousin instead of dearest. 

"What are you doing here?” 
Grimp asked bluntly instead. 

"Waiting,” said the policeman. 

"For what?” said Grimp, with a 
sinking heart. 

"Same individual you are, I 
guess,” the policeman told him, 
hauling out the handkerchief again. 



He blew. "This year she’s going to 
go right back where she came from 
or get pinched.” 

"Who says so?” scowled Grimp. 
"The Guardian, that's who,” said 
the policeman. "That good enough 
for you?” 

"He can’t do it!” Grimp said 
hotly. "It’s our farm, and she’s got 
all her licenses.” 

"He’s had a whole year to think 
up a new list she’s got to have,” 
the policeman informed him. He 
fished in the breast-pocket of his 
uniform, pulled out a folded paper 
and opened it. "He put thirty-four 
items down here I got to check — 
she’s bound to miss on one of 
them.” 

"It’s a dirty trick!” said Grimp, 
rapidly scanning "as much as he 
could see of the list. 

"Let’s us have more respect for 
the Village Guardian, Grimp!” the 
policeman said warningly. 

"Uh-huh,” muttered Grimp. 
"Sure . If Runny would just 
move his big thumb out of the way. 
But what a list! Trailer; rhinocerine 
pony (beast, heavy draft, import- 
ed); patent medicines; household 
utensils; fortune-telling; pets; 
herbs; miracle-healing — 

The policeman looked down, saw 
what Grimp was doing and raised 
the paper out of his line of vision. 
"That’s an official document,” he 
said, warding Grimp off with one 
hand and tucking the paper away 
with the other. "Let’s us not get 
our dirty hands on it.” 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Grimp was thinking fast. Grand- 
ma Wannattel did have framed li- 
censes for some of the items he’d 
read hanging around inside the 
trailer, but certainly not thirty-four 
of them. 

"Remember that big skinless 
werret I caught last season?” he 
asked. 

The policeman gave him a quick 
glance, looked away again and 
wiped his eyes thoughtfully. The 
season on werrets would open the 
following week and he was as 
ardent a fisherman as anyone in the 
village — and last summer Grimp’s 
monster werret had broken a 
twelve-year record in the valley. 

"Some people,” Grimp said idly, 
staring down the valley road to the 
point where it turned into the 
woods, "would sneak after a person 
for days who’s caught a big wer- 
ret, hoping he’d be dumb enough 
to go back to that pool.” 

The policeman flushed and 
dabbed the handkerchief gingerly 
at his nose. 

"Some people would even sit in 
a haystack and use spyglasses, even 
when the hay made them sneeze 
like crazy," continued Grimp 
quietly. 

The policeman's flush deepened. 
He sneezed. 

"But a person isn’t that dumb,”, 
said Grimp. "Not when he knows 
there’s anyway two werrets there six 
inches bigger than the one he ; 
caught.” 

"Six inches?” the policeman re- 



peated a bit incredulously — eagerly. 

"Easy,” nodded Grimp. ”1 had a 
look at them again last week.” 

It was the policeman’s turn to 
think. Grimp idly hauled out his 
slingshot, fished a pebble out of 
his small-pebble pocket and 
knocked the head off a flower 
twenty feet away. He yawned 
negligently. 

"You’re pretty good with that 
slingshot,” the policeman remarked. 
"You must be just about as good as 
the culprit that used a slingshot to 
ring the fire-alarm signal on the 
defense unit bell from the top of 
the schoolhouse last week.” 

"That’d take a pretty good shot,” 
Grimp admitted. 

"And who then,” continued the 
policeman, "dropped pepper in his 
trail, so the pank-hound near 
coughed off his head when we start- 
ed to track him. The Guardian,” 
he added significantly, "would like 
to have a clue about that culprit, 
all right.” 

"Sure, sure,” said Grimp, bored. 
The policeman, the Guardian, and 
probably even the pank-hound, 
knew exactly who the culprit was; 
but they wouldn’t be able to prove 
it in twenty thousand years. Runny 
just had to realize first that threats 
weren’t going to get him anywhere 
near a record werret. 

Apparently, he had; he was set- 
tling back for another bout of 
thinking. Grimp, interested in what 
he would produce next, decided 
just to leave him to it. 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



» 



Then Grimp jumped up sudden- 
ly from the rock. 

"There they are!” he yelled, 
waving the slingshot. 

A half-mile down the road. 
Grandma Wannattel’s big, silvery 
trailer had come swaying out of the 
woods behind the rhinocerine pony 
and turned up toward the farm. 
The pony saw Grimp, lifted its 
head, which was as long as a tall 
man, and bawled a thunderous 
greeting. Grandma Wannattel stood 
up on the driver's seat and waved 
a green silk handkerchief. 

Grimp started sprinting down 
the road. 

The werrets should turn the trick 
— but he’d better get Grandma in- 
formed, just the same, about recent 
developments here, before she ran 
into Runny. 

RANDMA WANNATTEL 
flicked the pony’s horny rear 
with the reins just before they 
reached the policeman, who was 
waiting at the side of the road 
with the Guardian’s check-list un- 
folded in his hand. 

The pony broke into a lumbering 
trot, and the trailer swept past 
Runny arid up around the bend of 
the road, where it stopped well 
within the boundaries of the farm. 
They climbed down and Grandma 
quickly unhitched the pony. It 
waddled, grunting, off the road and ' 
down into the long, marshy mea- 
dow above the hollow. It stood 
still there, cooling its feet. 



Grimp felt a little better. Getting 
the trailer off community property 
gave Grandma a technical advan- 
tage. Grimp’s people had a favor- 
able opinion of her, and they were 
a sturdy lot who enjoyed telling 
off the Guardian any time he didn’t 
actually have a law to back up his 
orders. But on the way to the farm, 
she had confessed to Grimp that, 
just as he’d feared, she didn’t have 
anything like thirty-four licenses. 
And now the policeman was com- 
ing up around the bend of the road 
after them, blowing his nose and 
frowning. 

"Just let me handle him alone,” 
Grandma told Grimp out of the 
corner of her mouth. 

He nodded and strolled off into 
the meadow to pass the time with 
the pony. She’d had a lot of ex- 
perience in handling policemen. 

"Well, well, young man,” he 
heard her greeting his cousin be- 
hind him. "That looks like a bad 
cold you’ve got.” 

The 'policeman sneezed. 

"Wish it were a cold,” he said 
resignedly. "It's hay-fSver. Can’t do 
a thing with it. Now I’ve got a list 
here — ” 

"Hay-.fever?” said Grandma. 
"Step up into the trailer a mo- 
ment. We’ll fix that.” 

"About this list — ” began 

Runny, and stopped. "You think 
you got something that would fix 
it?” he asked skeptically. 'I’ve been 
to I don’t know how many doctors 
and they didn’t help any.” 




10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Doctors!” said Grandma. 
Grimp heard her heels click up the 
metal steps that led into the back 
of the trailer. "Come right in, 
won’t take a moment.” 

"Well — said Runny doubt- 
fully, but he followed her inside. 

Grimp winked at the pony. The 
.first round went to Grandma. 

"Hello, pony,” he said. 

His worries couldn't reduce his 
appreciation of Grandma’s fabulous 
draft-animal. Partly, of course, it 
was just that it was such an enor- 
mous beast. The long, round barrel 
of its body rested on short legs with 
wide, flat feet which were settled 
deep in the meadow’s mud by now. 
At one end was a spiky tail, and 
at the other a very big, wedge- 
shaped head, with a blunt, badly 
chipped horn set between nose and 
eyes. From nose to tail and all 
around, it was covered with thick, 
rectangular, homy plates, a mottled 
green-brown in color. It weighed 
as much as a long-extinct terrestrial 
elephant, but that was because it 
was only a pony. 

Grimp patted its rocky side af- 
fectionately. He loved the pony 
most for being the ugliest thing 
that had ever showed up on Noor- 
hut. According to Grandma, she 
had bought it from a bankrupt cir- 
cus which had imported it from a 
planet called Treebel; and Treebei 1 
was supposed to be a world full o£; 
hot swamps, inexhaustibly explosive 
volcanoes and sulphurous stenches. 

One might have thought that 



after wandering around melting 
lava and under rainfalls of glowing 
ashes for most of its life, the pony 
would have considered Noorhut 
pretty tame. But though there 
wasn’t much room for expression 
around the solid slab of bone sup- 
porting the horn, which was the 
front of its face, Grimp thought it 
looked thoroughly contented with 
its feet sunk out of sight in Noo»- 
hut’s cool mud. 

"You’re a big fat pig!” he told 
it fondly. 

The pony slobbered out a long, 
purple tongue and carefully parted 
his hair. 

"Cut it out!” said Grimp. 
"Ugh!” 

The pony snorted, pleased, 
curled its tongue about a huge 
clump of weeds, pulled them up 
and flipped them into its mouth, 
roots, mud and all. It began to 
chew. 

Grimp glanced at the sun and 
turned anxiously to study the trail- 
er. If she didn’t get rid of Runny 
soon, they’d be calling him back to 
the house for supper before he and 
Grandma got around to having a 
good talk. And they weren’t letting 
him out of doors these evenings, 
while the shining lights were here. 

He gave the pony a parting 
whack, returned quietly to the road 
and sat down out of sight near the 
back door of the trailer, where he 
could hear what was going on.

now," the policeman was saying, 
"would be a Public Menace charge. 
If there’s any trouble about the 
lights this year, he’s likely to try 
that. He’s not a bad Guardian, you 
know, but he’s got himself talked 
into thinking you’re sort of to 
blame for the lights showing up 
here every year.” 

Grandma chuckled. "Well, I try 
to get here in time to see them 
every summer,” she admitted. ”1 
can see how that might give him 
the idea.” 

"And of course,” said the police- 
man, "we’re all trying to keep it 
quiet about them. If the news got 
out, we’d be having a lot of people 
coming here from the city, just to 
look. No one but the Guardian 
minds you being here, only you 
don’t want a lot of city people 
tramping around your farms.” 

"Of course not,” agreed Grand- 
ma. "And I certainly haven’t told 
anyone about them myself.” 

"Last night,” the policeman add- 
ed, "everyone was saying there were 
twice as many lights this year as 
last summer. That’s what got the 
Guardian so excited.” 

Chafing more every minute, 
Grimp had to listen then to an ex- 
tended polite argument about how 
much Runny wanted to pay Grand- 
ma for her hay-fever medicines, 
while she insisted he didn’t ' owe 
her anything at all. In the end, 
Grandma lost and the policeman 
paid up — much too much to take 
from any friend of Grimp’s folks, 



Grandma protested to the last. And 
then, finally, that righteous minion 
of the law came climbing down the 
trailer steps again, with Grandma 
following him to the door. 

"How do I look, Grimp?” he 
beamed cheerfully as Grimp stood 
up. 

"Like you ought to wash your 
face sometime,” Grimp said tact- 
lessly, for he was fast losing pa- 
tience with Runny. But then his 
eyes widened in surprise. 

Under a coating of yellowish 
grease, Runny’s nose seemed to 
have returned almost to the shape it 
had out of hay-fever season, and his 
eyelids were hardly puffed at all! 
Instead of flaming red, those fea- 
tures, furthermore, now were only 
a delicate pink in shade. Runny, in 
short, was almost handsome again. 

"Pretty good, eh?” he said. "Just 
one shot did it. And I’ve only got 
to keep the salve on another hour. 
Isn’t that right, Grandma?” 

"That’s right,” smiled Grandma 
from the door, clinking Runny’s 
money gently out of one hand into 
the other. "You’ll be as good as 
new then.” 

"Permanent cure, too,” said 
Runny. He patted Grimp benevo- 
lently on the head. "And next week 
we go werret-fishing, eh, Grimp?” 
he added greedily. 

”1 guess so,” Grimp said, with a 
trace of coldness. It was his opinion 
that Runny could have been satis- 
fied with the hay-fever cure and 
forgotten about the werrets.

"It’s a date!” nodded" Runny 
happily and took his greasy face 
whistling down the road. Grimp 
scowled after him, half-minded to 
reach for the slingshot then and 
there and let go with a medium 
stone at the lower rear of the uni- 
form. But probably he’d better not. 

"Well, that’s that,” Grandma 
said softly. 

At that moment, up at the farm- 
house, a cow horn went "Whoop- 
whoop!” across the valley. 

"Darn," said Grimp. "I knew it 
was getting late, with him doing 
all that talking! Now they’re call- 
ing me to supper.” There were tears 
of disappointment in his eyes. 

"Don't let' it fuss you, Grimp,” 
Grandma said consolingly. "Just 
jump up in here a moment and 
close your eyes.” 

Grimp jumped up into the trail- 
er and closed his eyes expectantly. 

"Put out your hands,” Grand- 
ma’s voice told him. 

He put out his hands, and she 
pushed them together to form a 
cup. Then something small and 
light and furry dropped into them, 
caught hold of one of Grimp’s 
thumbs, with tiny, cool fingers, and 
chittered. 

Grimp’s eyes popped open. 

"It’s a lortel!” he whispered, 
overwhelmed. 

"It’s for you!” Grandma beamed. 

Grimp couldn’t speak. The lortel 
looked at him from a tiny, black, 
human face with large blue eyes 
set in it, wrapped a long, furry tail 



twice around his wrist, clung to his 
thumb with its fingers, and grinned 
and squeaked. 

"It’s wonderful!” gasped Grimp. 
"Can you really teach them to 
’talk?” 

"Hello,” said the lortel. 

"That’s all it can say so far,” 
Grandma said. "But if you’re pa- 
tient with it, it’ll learn more.” 

"I’ll be patient,” Grimp prom- 
ised, dazed. "I saw one at the cir- 
cus this winter, down the valley at 
Laggand. They said it could talk, 
but it never said anything while I 
was there.” 

"Hello!” said the lortel. 

"Hello!” gulped Grimp. 

The cow horn whoop-whooped 
again. 

”1 guess you’d better run along 
to supper, or they might get mad,” 
said Grandma. 

"I know,” said Grimp. "What 
does it eat?" 

"Bugs and flowers and honey 
and fruit and eggs, when it’s wild. 
But you just feed it whatever you 
eat yourself.” 

"Well, good-by,” said Grimp. 
"And golly — thanks. Grandma.” 

He jumped out of the trailer. 
The lortel climbed out of his hand, 
ran up his arm and sat on his shoul- 
der, wrapping its tail around his 
neck. 

"It knows you already,” Grand- 
ma said. "It won’t run away.” 

Grimp reached up carefully with 
his other hand and patted the lortel. 

"I’ll be back early tomorrow,” 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



13 



he said. "No school. They 
won't let me out after supper as 
long as those lights keep coming 
around.” 

The cow horn whooped for the 
third time, very loudly. This time 
it meant business. 

"Well, good-by,” Grimp repeat- 
ed hastily. He ran off, the lortel 
hanging on to his shirt collar and 
squeaking. 

Grandma looked after him and 
then at the sun, which had just 
touched the tops of the hills with 
its lower rim. 

"Might as well have some sup- 
per myself,” she remarked, appar- 
ently to no one in particular. "But 
after that I’ll have to run out the 
go-buggy and create a diversion.” 

Lying on its armor-plated belly 
down in the meadow, the pony 
swung its big head around toward 
her. Its small yellow eyes blinked 
questioningly. 

"What makes you think a diver- 
sion will be required?” its voice 
asked into her ear. The ability to 
produce such ventriloquial effects 
was one of the talents that made-- 
the pony well worth its consider ’ 
able keep to Grandma. 

"Weren’t you listening?" she 
scolded. "That policeman told me 



the Guardian's planning to march 
the village's defense unit up to the 
hollow after supper, and start them 
shooting at the Halpa detector- 
globes as soon as they show up.” 

The pony swore an oath mean- 
ingless to anyone who hadn't been 
raised on the planet Treebel. It 
stood up, braced itself, and began 
pulling its feet out of the mud in 
a succession of loud, sucking noises. 

"I haven’t had an hour’s straight 
rest since you talked me into tramp- 
ing around with you eight years 
ago!” it complained. 

"But you’ve certainly been see- 
ing life, like I promised,” Grand- 
ma smiled. 

The pony slopped in a last, enor- 
mous tongueful of wet weeds. 
"That I have!” it said, with em- 
phasis. 

It came chewing up to the road. 

* "I’ll keep a watch on things 
while you’re having your supper," 
it told her. 

A S THE uniformed twelve-man 
defense unit marched in good 
order out of the village, on its way 
to assume a strategic position 
around the hollow on Grimp’s 
father’s farm, there was a sudden, 
small explosion not very far offT 




14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Guardian, who was march- 
ing in the lead with a gun over his 
shoulder and the slavering pank- 
hound on a leash, stopped short. 
The unit broke ranks and crowded 
up behind him. 

"What was that?" the Guardian 
inquired. 

Everybody glanced questioningly 
around the rolling green slopes of 
the valley, already darkened with 
evening shadows. The pank-hound 
sat down before the Guardian, 
pointed its nose at the even darker 



shadows in the woods ahead of 
them and growled. 

"Look!" a man said, pointing in 
the same direction. 

A spark of bright green light 
had appeared on their path, just 
■where it entered the woods. The 
spark grew rapidly in size, became 
as big as a human head — then big- 
ger! Smoky green streamers seemed 
to be pouring out of it. 

"I’m going home right now,” 
someone announced at that point, 
sensibly enough. 




SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



15 



"Stand your ground!” the 
Guardian ordered, conscious of the 
beginnings of a general withdrawal 
movement behind him. He was an 
old soldier. He unslung his gun, 
cocked it and pointed it. The pank- 
hound got up on his six feet and 
bristled. 

"Stop!” the Guardian shouted at 
the green light. 

It expanded promptly to the size 
of a barrel, new streamers shoot- 
ing out from it and fanning about 
like hungry tentacles. 

He fired. 

"Run!” everybody yelled then. 
The pank-hound slammed back- 
ward against the Guardian’s legs, 
upsetting him, and streaked off 
after the retreating unit. The green 
light had spread outward jerkily 
into the shape of something like a 
many-armed, writhing starfish, al- 
most the size of the trees about it. 
Deep, hooting sounds came out of 
it as it started drifting down the 
path toward the Guardian. 

He got up on one knee and, in a 
single drumroll of sound, emptied 
all thirteen charges remaining in his 
gun into the middle of the starfish. 
It hooted more loudly, waved its 
arms more wildly, and continued 
to advance. 

He stood up quickly then, slung 
the gun over his shoulder and 
joined the retreat. By the time the 
unit reached the first houses of the 
village, he was well up in the front 
ranks again. And a few minutes 
later, he was breathlessly organizing 



the local defenses, employing the 
tactics that had shown their worth 
in the raids of the Laggand Bandits 
nine years before. 

The starfish, however, was mak- 
ing no attempt to follow up the val- 
ley people's rout. It was still on 
the path at the point where the 
Guardian had seen it last, waving 
its arms about and hooting menac- 
ingly at the silent trees. 

“fTTHAT should do it, I guess,” 

X Grandma Wannattel said. 
"Before the first projection fizzles 
out, the next one in the chain will 
start up where they can see it from 
the village. It ought to be past mid- 
night before anyone starts bother- 
ing about the globes again. Par- 
ticularly since there aren’t going to 
be any globes around tonight — that 

is, if the Halpa attack-schedule has 
been correctly estimated.” 

"I wish we were safely past mid- 
night right now,” the rhinocerine 
pony worriedly informed her. Its 
dark shape stood a little up the 
road from the trailer, outlined mo- 
tionlessly like a ponderous statue 
against the red evening sky. Its 
head was up; it looked as if it were 
listening. Which it was, in its own 
way — listening for any signs of ac- 
tivity from the hollow. 

"No sense getting anxious about 

it, ” Grandma remarked. She was 
perched on a rock at the side of the 
road, a short distance from the 
pony, with a small black bag slung 
over her shoulder. "We’ll wait here 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



another hour till it's good and dark 
and then go down to the hollow. 
The breakthrough might begin a 
couple of hours after that.” 

"It would have to be us again!” 
grumbled the pony. In spite of its 
size, its temperament was on the 
nervous side; and any companion of 
Grandma’s was bound to run reg- 
ularly into situations that were far 
from soothing. She belonged to a 
powerful human organization 
whose activities extended through- 
out most of those sections of the 
Galaxy where Terra's original colo- 
nies, and their branch-colonies, and 
branches of the branches, had 
grown down the centuries into new 
and independent civilizations. The 
role of the organization was that 
of watchdog for the safety of all, 
without regard for the often con- 
flicting rulings and aims of individ- 
ual governments; and sometimes 
that wider view made it necessary 
to take some very grim risks local- 
ly. Unfortunately, this was one of 
the times. 

"I’d 'feel a lot better myself if 
Headquarters hadn't picked us for 
this particular operation,” Grand- 
ma admitted. "Us and Noor- 
hut. .” 

Because, by what was a rather 
singular coincidence, considering 
how things stood there tonight, the 
valley was also Grandma’s home. 
She had been born, quite some 
while before, a hundred and eighty 
miles farther inland, at the foot of 
the dam of the great river Wend, 

SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



which had given its name to the 
land, and nowadays supplied it with 
almost all its required power. 

Erisa Wannattel had done a great 
deal of traveling since she first be- 
came aware of the fact that her 
varied abilities and adventuresome 
nature needed a different sort of 
task to absorb them than could be 
found on Noorhut, which was pro- 
gressing placidly up into the final 
stages of a rounded and balanced 
planetary civilization. But she still 
liked to consider the Valley of the 
Wend as her home and headquar- 
ters, to which she returned as often 
as her work would permit. Her 
exact understanding of the way 
people there thought about things 
and did things also made them easy 
for her to manipulate; and on oc- 
casion that could be very useful. 

In most other places, the means 
she had employed to turn the 
Guardian and his troop back from 
the hollow probably would have 
started a panic or brought armed 
ships and radiation guns zooming 
up for the kill within minutes. 
But the valley people had consid- 
ered it just another local emer- 
gency. The bronze alarm bell in the 
village had pronounced a state of 
siege, and cow horns passed the 
word up to the outlying farms. 
Within minutes, the farmers were 
jpeltirig down the roads to the vil- 
Ta^e with their families and guns; 
Wd; very soon afterward, every- 
thing quieted down again. Guard 
lines had been set up by then, with 

17 



the women and children quartered 
in the central buildings, while the 
armed men had settled down to 
watching Grandma’s illusion pro- 
jections — directional video narrow 
beams — from the discreet distance 
marked by the village boundaries. 

If nothing else happened, the 
people would just stay there till 
morning and then start a cautious 
investigation. After seeing mysteri- 
ous blue lights dancing harmless- 
ly over Grimp’s farm for four 
summers, this section of Wend was 
pretty well conditioned to fiery ap- 
paritions. But even if they got too 
adventurous, they couldn’t hurt 
themselves on the projections, 
which were designed to be nothing 
but very effective visual displays. 

What it all came to was that 
Grandma had everybody in the 
neighborhood rounded up and im- 
mobilized where she wanted them. 

I N EVERY other respect, the val- 
ley presented an exceptionally 
peaceful twilight scene to the eye. 
There was nothing to show that it 
was the only present point of con- 
tact between forces engaged in what 
was probably a war of intergalactic 
proportions — a war made wraith- 
like but doubly deadly by the cir- 
cumstance that, in over a thousand 
years, neither side had found out 
much more about the other than the 
merciless and devastating finality of 
its forms of attack. There never had 
been any actual battles between 
Mankind and the Halpa, only alter- 



nate and very thorough massacres 
— all of them, from Mankind's 
point of view, on the wrong side of 
the fence. 

The Halpa alone had the knowl- 
edge that enabled them to reach 
their human adversary. That was 
the trouble. But, apparently, they 
could launch their attacks only by 
a supreme effort, under conditions 
that existed for periods of less than 
a score of years, and about three 
hundred years apart as Mankind 
measured time. 

It was hard to find any good in 
■them, other than the virtue of per- 
sistence. Every three hundred years, 
they punctually utilized that brief 
period to execute one more thrust, 
carefully prepared and placed, and 
carried out with a dreadfully com- 
plete abruptness, against some new 
point of human civilization — and 
this time the attack was going to 
come through on Noorhut. 

"Something’s starting to move 
around in that hollow!” the pony 
announced suddenly. "It’s not one 
of their globe-detectors.” 

"I know,” murmured Grandma. 
"That’s the first of the Halpa them- 
selves. They’re going to be right on 
schedule, it seems. But don't get 
nervous. They can’t hurt anything 
until their transmitter comes 
through and revives them. We’ve 
got to be particularly careful now 
not to frighten them off. They seem 
to be even more sensitive to emo- 
tional tensions in their immediate 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



surroundings than the globes.” 

The pony made no reply. It knew 
what was at stake and why eight 
big ships were circling Noorhut 
somewhere beyond space-detection 
tonight. It knew, too, that' the ships 
would act only if it was discovered 
that Grandma had failed. But — 

The pony shook its head un- 
easily. The people on Treebel had 
never become civilized to the point 
of considering the possibility of 
taking calculated risks on a planet- 
ary scale — not to mention the fact 
that the lives of the pony and of 
Grandma were included in the pres- 
ent calculation. In the eight years 
it had been accompanying her on 
her travels, it had developed a tre- 
mendous respect for Erisa Wannat- 
tel’s judgment and prowess. But, 
just the same, frightening the 
Halpa off, if it still could be done, 
seemed like a very sound idea right 
now to the pony. 

As a matter of fact, as Grandma 
well knew, it probably could have 
been done at this stage by tossing 
a small firecracker into the hollow. 
Until they had established their 
planetary foothold, the Halpa took 
extreme precautions. They could 
spot things in the class of radia- 
tion weapons a hundred miles away, 
and either that or any suggestion 
of local aggressiveness or of long- 
range observation would check the 
invasion attempt on Noorhut then 
and there. 

But one of the principle reasons 
she was here tonight was to see 



that nothing did happen to stop it. 
For this assault would only be 
diverted against some other world 
then, and quite probably against 
one where the significance of the 
spying detector-globes wouldn’t be 
understood before it was too late. 
The best information system in the 
Galaxy couldn’t keep more than an 
insignificant fraction of its popula- 
tions on the alert for dangers like 
that — 

She bounced suddenly to her feet 
and, at the same instant, the pony 
swung away from the hollow to- 
ward which it had been staring. 
They both stood for a moment 
then, turning their heads about, like 
baffled hounds trying to fix a scent 
on the wind. 

"It’s Grimp!” Grandma ex- 
claimed. 

The rhinocerine pony snorted 
faintly. "Those are his thought 
images, all right,” it agreed. "He 
seems to feel you need protection. 

. Can you locate him?” 

"Not yet,” said Grandma anx- 
iously. "Yes, I can. He’s coming up 
through the woods on the other 
side of the hollow, off to the left. 
The little devil!" She was hustling 
back to the trailer. "Come on, I’ll 
have to ride you there. I can’t even 
dare use the go-buggy this late in 
the day.” 

The pony crouched beside the 
1 trailer while she quickly snapped 
on its saddle from the top of the 
back steps. Six metal rings had 
been welded into the horny plates 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



If 



of its back for this purpose, so it 
was a simple job. Grandma clam- 
bered aloft, hanging onto the sad- 
dle’s hand-rails. 

"Swing wide of the hollow,” she 
warned. "Grimp came just as I 
suggested him mentally to. You 
needn't worry about making noise. 
The Halpa don't notice noise as 
such — it has to have emotional con- 
tent for them to hear it — and the 
quicker Grimp spots us, the easier 
it will be to find him.” 

The pony already was rushing 
down into the meadow at an amaz- 
ing rate of speed — it took a lot of 
muscle to drive a body like that 
through the gluey swamps of Tree- 
bel, and there were none here to 
impede it. It swung wide of the 
hollow and of what it contained, 
crossed a shallow bog farther down 
the meadow with a sound like a 
charging torpedo-boat, and reached 
the woods. 

It had to slow down then to 
avoid brushing off Grandma. 

"Grimp’s down that slope some- 
where,” Grandma said. "He’s heard 
us. 

"They’re making a lot of noise,” 
Grimp’s thought reached them sud- 
denly and clearly. He seemed to 
be talking to someone. "But we’re 
not scared of them, are we?” 

"Bang-bang!” another voice- 
thought came excitedly. 

"That was the lortel,” Grandma 
said. "They’re very good for giving 
children courage. Much better than 
Teddy Bears.” 



"That’s the stuff,” Grimp re- 
sumed approvingly. "We’ll sling- 
shot them all if they don’t watch 
out. But we’d better find Grandma 
soon.” 

"Grimp!” shouted Grandma. The 
pony backed her up with a roaring 
call. 

"Hello?” came the lortel’s 
thought. 

"Wasn’t that the pony?” Grimp 
asked it, getting only another 
"hello” in reply. "All right, we’ll 
go that way,” he added, as though 
they had reached a joint decision. 

"Here we come, Grimp!” Grand- 
ma shouted, and the pony de- 
scended the steep side of a ravine 
with the straightforward technique 
of a rock slide. 

"That's Grandma!” thought 
Grimp. "Grandma!” he yelled. 
"Look out, there’s monsters all 
around !” 

“TTTHAT you missed!” yelled 

VV Grimp, dancing around the 
pony as Grandma Wannattel scram- 
bled down from the saddle. "The 
monsters have the village sur- 
rounded, and the Guardian killed 
one and I slingshot another till he 
fizzled out, and I was coming to 
find you — ” 

"Your mother will be worried,” 
said Grandma as they rushed into 
each other’s arms. 

' "No,” grinned Grimp. "All the 
kids are supposed to be sleeping in 
the school house, and she won’t 
look there till morning, and the 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



teacher said the monsters were all 
holynations — ho-lucy-nations. But 

he wouldn't go look when the 
Guardian said they’d show him 
one. He stayed right in bed! But 
the Guardian’s all right — he killed 
one, and I slingshot another one 
and the lortel learned a new word. 
Say ’bang-bang,’ lortel!” 

"Hello!” squeaked the lortel. 
"Aw, he’s scared,” said Grimp 
disappointedly. "He can say it, 
though. And I’ve come to take you 
to the village so the monsters don't 
chase after you. Hello, pony!” 
"Bang-bang,” said the lortel dis- 
tinctly. 

"See?” cried Grimp. "He wasn’t 
scared, after all — he’s a real brave 
lortel! If we see some monsters, 
don’t you get scared, either, because 
I've got my slingshot,” he said, 
waving it bloodthirstily, "and two 
back pockets all full of real big 
stones. I just hope my pants stay 
up. But that doesn’t matter — the 
way to do it is to kill them all.” 

"It sounds like a pretty good 
idea, Grimp,” Grandma agreed. 
"But you're awfully tired now.” 
"No, I’m not!” Grimp said, sur- 
prised. His right eye sagged shut 
and then his left. He opened them 
both with an effort and looked at 
Grandma. ”1 can stay awake all 
night, I bet,” he argued drowsily. 
”1 am — ” 

"In fact,” said Grandma, "you’re 
asleep." Lii 

"No, I'm n — ” objected Grimp. 
Then he sagged toward the ground, 



and Grandma caught him firmly. 

"In a way, I hate to do it,” she 
panted, wrestling him aboard the 
pony, which had hunkered down 
and flattened itself as much as it 
could to make the job easier. "He’d 
probably enjoy it. But we can’t take 
a chance. He's a husky little devil, 
too,” she groaned, giving a final 
boost, "and those ammunition 
pockets don’t make him any 
lighter.” She clambered up again 
behind him and noticed that the 
lortel had transferred itself to her 
coat collar. 

The pony stood up cautiously. 

"Now what?” it asked. 

"Might as well go straight to the 
hollow,” said Grandma, breathing 
hard. "We’ll probably have to wait 
around there a few hours, but if 
we're careful it won’t do any 
harm.” 

<<TN1D you find a good deep 

i-f pond?” Grandma asked the 
pony a little later, as it came squish- 
ing up softly through the meadow 
behind her to rejoin her at the 
edge of the hollow. 

"Yes,” said the pony. "About a 
hundred yards back. That should 
be dose enough. How much more 
waiting do you think we’ll have to 
do?” 

Grandma shrugged carefully. She 
was sitting in the grass with what, 
by daylight, would have been a 
good view of the hollow below. 
Grimp was asleep with his head on 
her knees. The lortel, after catching 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



21 



a few bugs in the grass and eating 
them, had settled down on her 
shoulder and dozed off, too. 

"I don’t know,” she said. "It’s 
still three hours till Big .Moonrise, 
and it’s bound to be some time be- 
fore then. Now that you’ve found 
a waterhole, we’ll just stay here to- 
gether and wait. The one thing to 
remember is not to let yourself start 
getting excited about them.” 

The pony stood huge and chunky 
beside her, staring down, its fore- 
feet on the edge of the hollow. 
Muddy water trickled from its 
knobby flanks. It had brought the 
warm mud-smells of a summer 
pond back with it to hang in a 
cloud about them. 

There was vague, dark, continu- 
ous motion at the bottom of the 
hollow. A barely noticeable stirring 
in the single big pool of darkness 
that filled it. 

"If I were alone,” the pony 
said, "I’d get out of here! I know 
when I ought to be scared. But 
you’ve taken psychological control 
of my reactions, haven’t you?” 
"Yes,” said Grandma. "It’ll be 
easier for me, though, if you help 
along as much as you can. There’s 
really no danger until their trans- 
mitter has come through.” 

"Unless,” objected the pony, 
"they’ve worked out some brand- 
new tricks in the past few hundred 
years.” 

"There’s that chance,” Grandma 
admitted. "But they’ve never tried 
changing their tricks on us yet. If 

22 



it were us doing the attacking, we’d 
vary our methods each time, as 
much as we' could. But the Halpa 
don’t seem to think the way 
we do about anything. They 
wouldn’t still be so careful if they 
didn’t realize they were very vul- 
nerable at this point.” 

"I hope they’re right about 
that!” the pony said anxiously. 

Its head moved then, following 
the motion of something that sailed 
flutteringly out of the depths of 
the hollow, circled along its far 
rim, and descended again. The be- 
ings of Treebel had a much deeper 
range of night vision than Grand- 
ma Wannattel, but she was also 
aware of that shape. 

"They’re not much to look at,” 
the pony remarked. "Like a big, 
dark rag of leather, almost.” 

"Their physical structure is be- 
lieved to be quite simple," Grand- 
ma agreed slowly. 

The pony was tensing up again, 
and she realized that it was best to 
go on talking to it, about almost 
anything at all. That always helped, 
even though the pony knew her 
much too well by now to be really 
fooled by such tricks. 

"Many very efficient life-forms 
aren’t physically complicated, you 
know,” she went on, letting the 
sbund of her voice ripple steadily 
into its mind. "Parasitical types, 
particularly. It’s pretty certain, too, 
fhiat the Halpa have the hive-mind 
class of intelligence, so what goes 
for the nerve systems of most of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the ones they send through to us 
might be nothing much more than 
secondary reflex-transmitters. 

Grimp stirred in his sleep at 
that point and grumbled. Grandma 
looked down at him. "You’re 
sound asleep !” she told him se- 
verely, and he was again. 

"You’ve got plans for that boy, 
haven’t you?’’ said the pony, with- 
out shifting its gaze from the 
hollow. 

“I’ve had my eye on him,” 
Grandma admitted, "and I’ve al- 
ready recommended him to the or- 
ganization for observation. That’s 
if we beat off the Halpa this time 
— and Grimp will be pretty impor- 
tant in deciding that. If we do, 
we’ll let him develop with only a 
little help here and there. We’ll see 
what he picks up naturally from the 
lortel, for instance, in the way of 
telepathic communication and sen- 
sory extensions. I think Grimp’s 
the kind we can use.” 

“He’s all right,” the pony agreed 
absently. "A bit murderous, though, 
like most of you. .” 

"He’ll grow out of it!” Grandma 
said, a little annoyedly, for the 
subject of human aggressiveness 
was one she and the pony argued 
about frequently. "You can’t hurry 
developments like that along too 
much. All of Noorhut should grow 
out of that stage, as a people, in 
another few hundred years. They’re 
about at the turning-point right 
now — ” 

Their heads came up together 



then, as something very much like 
a big, dark rag of leather came 
fluttering up from the hollow and 
hung in the dark air above them. 
The representatives of the opposing 
powers that were facing each other 
on Noorhut that night took quiet 
stock of one another for a few 
moments. 

T HE Halpa was about six feet 
long and two feet wide, and 
considerably less than an inch 
thick. It held its position in the air 
with a steady, rippling motion, like 
a bat the size of a man, and then 
suddenly it extended itself with a 
snap, growing taut as a curved sail. 

The pony snorted involuntarily. 
The apparently featureless shape in 
the air turned toward it and drifted 
a few inches closer. When nothing 
more happened, it turned again 
and fluttered quietly back down 
into the hollow. 

"Could it tell I was scared?” thg 
pony asked uneasily. 

"You reacted just right,” 
Grandma soothed. "Startled sus- 
picion at first, and then just curios- 
ity, and then another start when it 
made that jump. It’s about what 
they’d expect from creatures that 
would be hanging around the hol- 
low now. We’re like cows to them. 
They can’t tell what things are by 
their looks, as we do.” 

But her tone was thoughtful, and 
she was more shaken than she 
would have cared to let the pony 
notice. There had been something 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



23 



indescribably menacing and self- 
assured in the Halpa’s attitude. Al- 
most certainly, it had only been 
trying to draw a reaction of hostile 
intelligence from them, probing, 
perhaps, for the presence of weap- 
ons that might be dangerous to its 
kind. 

But there was a chance — a tiny 
but appalling chance — that the 
things had developed some dras- 
tically new form of attack since 
their last breakthrough, and that 
they already were in control of the 
situation. 

In which case, neither Grimp 
nor anyone else on Noorhut would 
be doing any more growing up 
after tomorrow. 

Each of the eleven hundred and 
seventeen planets that had been lost 
to the Halpa so far still traced a 
fiery, forbidding orbit through 
space — torn back from the invad- 
ers only at the cost of depriving it, 
by humanity’s own weapons, of 
the natural conditions that any 
known form of life could toler- 
ate. 

The possibility that that might 
also be Noorhut’s future had 
loomed as an ugly enormity be- 
fore her for the past four years. 
But of the nearly half a hundred 
worlds which the Halpa were 
found to be investigating, through 
their detector-globes, as possible 
mvasion points for this assault pe- 
riod, Noorhut finally had been 
selected by Headquarters as the 
one where local conditions were 

24 



most suited to meet them success- 
fully. That meant in a manner that 
must include the destruction of 
their only real invasion weapon, 
the fabulous and mysterious Halpa 
Transmitter. Capable as they un- 
doubtedly were, they had shown in 
the past that they were able or 
willing to employ only one of those 
instruments for each period of at- 
tack. Destroying the transmitter 
meant, therefore, that humanity 
would gain a few more centuries 
to figure out a way to get back at 
the Halpa before a new invasion 
attempt was made. 

S O ON all planets but Noorhut, 
the detector-globes shrewdly 
had been encouraged to send back 
reports of a dangerously alert and 
well-armed population. On Noor- 
hut, however, they had been 
soothed along . and just as her 
home planet had been chosen as 
the most favorable point of en- 
counter, so was Erisa Wannattel 
herself selected as the agent most 
suited to represent humanity’s 
fptces under the conditions that 
existed there. 

Grandma sighed gently and re- 
minded herself again that Head- 
quarters was as unlikely to miscal- 
culate the overall probability of 
success as it was to select the 
wrong person to achieve it. There 
w^s' only the tiniest, the most theo- 
retical, of chances that something 
might go wrong, and that she 
would end 'her long career with 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the blundering murder of her own 
home world — 

But there was that chance. It 
meant the lives of people whose 
ancestors she had known, an entire 
world she loved and hoped to re- 
tire to some day. Worse yet, it 
meant relying on a small, helpless, 
untrained Child — who might, after 
all, not be the instrument she 
should have chosen. 

, "There seem to be more down 
there every minute!" the pony was 
saying. 

Grandma drew a deep breath. 

"Must be several thousand by 
now,” she acknowledged. "It's get- 
ting near breakthrough time, all 
right — but that’s only the advance 
forces.” She added, "Do you no- 
tice anything like a glow of light 
down there, toward the center?” 

The pony stared a moment. 
"Yes,” it said. "But I would have 
thought that was way under the 
red for you. Can you see it?” 

"No,” said Grandma. "I get a 
kind of feeling, like heat. That’s 
the transmitter beginning to come 
through. I think we’ve got them!” 

The pony shifted its bulk slow- 
ly from side to side. 

"Yes,” it said resignedly, "or 
they’ve got us.” 

"Don't think about that,” 
Grandma ordered sharply and 
clamped one more mental lock shut 
on the foggy, dark terrors that were 
curling and writhing under her 
conscious thoughts, trying to 
emerge and paralyze her actions. 



She had opened her black bag 
and was unhurriedly fitting to- 
gether something composed of a 
few pieces of wood and wire, and 
a father heavy, stiff spring. 
"Just be ready,” she added. 

"I’ve been ready for an hour,” 
said the pony, shuffling its feet. 

"I mean Grimp,” she explained, 
looking down at the sleeping boy 
intently. "A child is more percep- 
tive than an adult, and his time 
sense is sharper because he lives 
at a much faster rate.” 

"Then his time sense should be 
faster, too,” the pony said. 

"It’s like slow-motion film,” 
Grandma told him. "The faster the 
camera goes, the more pictures it 
takes and the slower the action. A 
child is like that. Our time sense 
speeds up as we grow older and 
our life processes slow down. You 
might say we take fewer pictures 
than a child does.” 

"Makes sense,” the pony agreed. 
"But what does it lead to?” 

"Grimp,” said Grandma, her 
face very close to the boy’s, "is 
going to feel the critical moment 
of the breakthrough and let us 
know. He’ll tell by the static ten- 
sion in the air, the way a child be- 
comes cranky when an electrical 
storm is getting ready to happen. 
We can’t respond like that . 
even trained perceptives like -us 
. and not, certainly, in aware- 
ness of fractions of a second. ” 

The pony stared at Grimp with 
new respect. "He can?” 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



25 



G RANDMA took in a breath 
that sounded like the flutter- 
ing of agitated strips of paper. "I 
hope so,” she said. "It can't be 
just any child, though all of them 
are more sensitive than any adult. 
It has to be a hyper-sensitive 
child.” 

"Then you’re not sure he is.” 
"No,” Grandma confessed re- 
luctantly. "I can’t be sure until 
it’s too late.” 

They did no more talking after 
that. All the valley had become 
quiet about them. But slowly the 
hollow below was filling up with 
a black, stirring, slithering tide. 
Bits of it fluttered up now and 
then like strips of black smoke, 
hovered a few yards above the 
mass, and settled again. 

Suddenly, down in the center of 
the hollow, there was something 
else. 

The rhinocerine pony had seen 
it first. Grandma Wannattel real- 
ized. It had been staring in that 
direction for almost a minute be- 
fore she grew able to distinguish 
something that might have been a 
group of graceful miniature spires. 
Semi-transparent in the darkness, 
four small domes showed at the 
corners, with a larger one in the 
center. The central one was about 
twenty feet high and very slender. 

The whole structure began to 
solidify- swiftly. 

The Halpa Transmitter's appear- 
ance of crystalline slightness was 
perhaps the most mind-chilling 

u 



thing about it. For it brought in- 
stantly a jarring sense of what 
must be black distance beyond all 
distances, reaching back unimag- 
inably to its place of origin. In 
that unknown somewhere, a prodi- 
giously talented and determined 
race of beings had labored for hu- 
man centuries to prepare and point 
some stupendous gun . and 
were able then to bridge the vast 
interval with nothing more sub- 
stantial than this dark sliver of 
glass that had come to rest sud- 
denly in the valley of the Wend] 

But, of course, the Transmitter 
was all that was needed; its deadly 
poison lay in a sluggish, almost 
inert mass about it. Within minutes 
from now, it would waken to life, 
as similar transmitters had wak- 
ened on other nights on those lost 
and burning worlds. And in much 
less than minutes after that, the 
Halpa invaders would be hurled by 
their slender machine to every 
surface section of Noorhut — no 
longer inert, but quickened into a 
ravening, almost indestructible 
form of vampiric life, dividing and 
sub-dividing in its incredibly swift 
cycle of reproduction, fastening to 
feed anew, growing again — 

Spreading, at that stage, much 
more swiftly than it could be ex- 
terminated by anything but the 
ultimate weapons! 

jThe pony stirred suddenly, and 
she felt the wave of panic rolling 
up in it. 

"It’s the Transmitter, all right,” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Grandma’s thought reached it 
quickly. "We've had two descrip- 
tions of it before. But we can't be 
sure it’s here until it begins to 
charge itself. Then it lights up — 
first at the edges, and then at the 
center. Once the central spire lights 
up, it will be energized too much . 
to let them pull it back again. At 
least, they couldn’t pull it back 
after that last time they were 
observed.” She touched the sleep- 
ing boy anxiously. "Grimp will 
have to tell us when that exact in- 
stant is.” 

The pony had been told all that 
before. But as it listened, it was 
quieting down again. 

"And you’re to go on sleeping!" 
Grandma Wannattel’s thought in- 
structed Grimp next. "Your per- 
ception and time sense are to be 
alert, but you’ll sleep on and re- 
member nothing until I wake you." 

L IGHT surged suddenly up in 
the Transmitter — first into the 
four outer spires, and a moment 
later into the big central one, in 
a sullen red glow. It lit the hol- 
low with a smoky glare. The pony 
took two startled steps backward. 

"Don't fail us, Grimp!” whis- 
pered Grandma’s thought. 

She reached again into her black 
bag and took out a small plastic 
ball. It reflected the light from the 
hollow in dull crimson gleamiiigs. 
She let it slip down carefully In- 
side the shaftlike frame of the 
gadget she had put together of 



wood and wire. It clicked into 
place there against one end of the 
compressed spring. 

But she didn’t take her eyes off 
the boy. He was stirring restlessly, 
his breathing growing quicker and 
more difficult. His little hands' 
twitched from time to time, 
though he remained asleep. 

"Watch the Halpa,” she tensely 
told the pony. "I don’t know if 
Grimp will sense the moment ex- 
actly. I’m not sure we can handle 
it then, but. 

Down below, they lay now in a 
blanket fifteen feet thick over the 
wet ground, like big, black, wa- 
ter-sogged leaves swept up in cir- 
cular piles about the edges of the 
hollow. The tops and sides of the 
piles were fluttering and shivering 
and beginning to slide down to- 
ward the Transmitter. She felt ten- 
sion growing, but she couldn’t 
trust her own age-dulled percep- 
tion. If the child failed, all Noor- 
hut would fall to the Halpa. 

Grimp twisted in Grandma’s 
arms abruptly, like a caught and 
fighting werret, and a strangled 
cry that was almost a sob came 
from him. 

It was what Grandma had been 
waiting for. She raised the wooden 
catapult to her shoulder. The pony 
shook its blunt-horned head vio- 
lently from side to side, made a 
loud bawling noise, surged for- 
ward and plunged down the steep 
slope of the hollow in a thunder- 
ing rush. 



SECOND NIGHT OF SUMMER 



27 



Grandma aimed carefully and let 

go- 

There was no explosion. The 
blanket of dead-leaf creatures was 
lifting into the air ahead of the 
pony's ground-shaking approach in 
a weightless, silent swirl of dark- 
ness, which instantly blotted both 
the glowing Transmitter and the 
pony’s shape from sight. The pony 
roared once as the blackness closed 
over it. A second later, there was 
a crash like the shattering of a 
hundred-foot mirror. At approxi- 
mately the same moment, Grand- 
ma’s plastic ball exploded some- 
where in the center of the swirling 
storm of lethal life. 

Cascading fountains of white 
fire filled the whole of the hollow. 
Within the fire, a dense mass of 
shapes fluttered and writhed fren- 
ziedly like burning rags. From 
down where the fire boiled fiercest 
rose continued sounds of brittle 
substances suffering enormous vio- 
lence. The pony was trampling the 
Transmitter, making sure of its de- 
struction. 

"Better get out of it!" Grandma 
shouted anxiously. "What’s left of 
that will all melt now, anyway!” 

She didn’t know whether it 
heard her or not, but a few seconds 
later, it came pounding up the side 
of the hollow again. Blazing from 
nose to rump, it tramped past 
Grandma, plunged through the 
meadow behind her, shedding 
white sheets of fire that exploded 
the marsh grass in its tracks, and 

28 



hurled itself headlong into the 
pond it had selected previously. 
There was a great splash, accom- 
panied by sharp hissing noises. 
Pond and pony vanished together 
under billowing clouds of steam. 

"That was pretty hot!" its 
thought came to Grandma. 

"Hot as anything that ever came 
out of a volcano!” she affirmed. "If 
you’d played around in it much 
longer, you'd have provided the 
village with roasts for a year.” 
"I’ll just stay here for a while, 
till I’ve cooled off a bit,” said the 
pony. "And I’d like to forget that 
last remark of yours, too. Civilized 
cannibals, that’s what people are!" 

G RANDMA found something 
strangling her then, and dis- 
covered it was the lortel’s tail. She 
unwound it carefully. But the lor- 
tel promptly reanchored itself with 
all four hands in her hair. She de- 
cided to leave it there. It seemed 
badly upset. 

Grimp, however, relaxed sud- 
denly and slept on. It was going 
to take a little maneuvering to get 
him back into the village undetect- 
ed before morning, but she would 
figure that out by and by. A steady 
flow of cool night air was being 
drawn past them into the hollow 
now, and rising out of it again in 
boiling, vertical columns of in- 
visible heat. At the bottom of the 
de-luxe blaze she’d lit down there, 
things still seemed to be moving 
about — but very slowly. The Halpa 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were tough organisms, all right, 
though not nearly so tough, when 
you heated them up with a really 
good incendiary, as the natives of 
Treebel. 

She would have to make a final 
check of the hollow around dawn, 
of course, when the ground should 
have cooled off enough to permit 
it — but her century’s phase of the 
Halpa War did seem to be over. 
The defensive part of it, at any 
rate. 

Wet munching sounds from the 
pond indicated the pony felt com- 
fortable enough by now to take 
an interest in the parboiled vegeta- 
tion it found floating about it. 

"You picked the right child, 
after all,” the pony’s thought re- 
marked to her. 

"Yes, Grimp worked out fine,” 
Grandma said a little proudly. 

”1 was pretty worried for a 
while.” 

"I won’t say I was exactly easy 
myself. I thought Grimp was re- 
acting slowly and I was getting 
ready to hurl the incendiary.” 

"But you didn’t,” the pony 
pointed out, chewing loudly. 

"No. I suspected my perception 
might be too fast. It turned out to 
be almost two minutes off.” 

The rhinocerine pony stopped 
munching and she felt the shiver 
of fear that went through its mind, 
"As much as that? You'd have 
caught the Transmitter before it j 
was matter. Nothing would have 
happened . except the Halpa 



would have swarmed through when 
the Transmitter materialized. We 
couldn’t have stopped them.” 
"Grimp had the crisis down to 
the micro-second,” she said hap- 
pily. "Why fret about what might 
have happened?” 

"You’re right, of course,” the 
pony agreed, but its enormous 
appetite seemed suddenly to have 
disappeared. 

Grandma settled down carefully 
to sleep in the long marsh grass 
without disturbing Grimp’s posi- 
tion too much. She appeared calm, 
but her sleep was more of a faint 
than untroubled slumber. 

B Y SUNRISE, Grandma Wan- 
nattel’s patent-medicine trailer 
was nine miles from the village 
and rolling steadily southward up 
the valley road through the woods. 
As usual, she was departing under 
an official cloud. 

Grimp and the policeman had 
showed up early to warn her. The 
Guardian was making use of the 
night’s various unprecedented dis- 
turbances to press through a vote 
on a Public Menace charge against 
Grandma in the village. Since 
everybody still felt rather excited 
and upset, he had a good chance 
just now of getting a majority. 

Grimp had accompanied her far 
enough to explain that this state 
of affairs wasn’t going to be per- 
manent. He had it all worked out: 
Runny’s new immunity to hay- 
fever had brought him and the

pretty Vellit to a fresh understand- 
ing overnight; they were going to 
get married five weeks from now. 
As a married man. Runny would 
then be eligible for the post of 
Village Guardian at the harvest 
elections. Between Grimp’s cousins 
and Vellit’s cousins, Runny’s back- 
ers would just about control the 
vote. So when Grandma got around 
to visiting the valley again next 
summer, she needn’t worry any 
more about police interference or 
official disapproval. 

Grandma had nodded approv- 
ingly. That was about the kind of 
neighborhood politics she’d begun 
to play herself at Grimp’s age. She 
was pretty sure by now that Grimp 
was the one who eventually would 
become her successor as guardian 
of Noorhut, as well as of the star- 
system to which Noorhut belonged, 
and perhaps of a good many other 
star-systems besides. With careful 
schooling, he ought to be just about 
ready for the job by the time she 
was willing, finally, to retire. 



ing ravine, at the far end of which 
lay something that Grimp would 
have recognized instantly as a small 
spaceship from his one visit to the 
nearest port city. 

A large round door opened 
soundlessly in its side as they 
approached. The pony came to a 
stop. Grandma got down from the 
driver’s seat and unhitched it. The 
pony walked into the airlock, and 
the trailer picked its wheels off the 
ground and floated in behind it. 
Grandma Wannattel walked in last, 
and the lock closed quietly. 

The ship lay still a moment 
longer. Then it was suddenly 
gone. Dead leaves went dancing 
for a while about the ravine, dis- 
turbed by the breeze of its depar- 
ture. 

In a place very far away — so far 
that neither Grimp nor his parents 
nor anyone in the village except 
the schoolteacher had ever heard 
of it — a set of instruments began 
signaling for attention. Somebody 
answered them. 

Grandma’s voice announced dis- 
tinctly; 

"This is Agent Wannattel’s re- 
port on the successful conclusion 
of the Halpa operation on Noor- 
hut — ”

JUDAS RAM 

BY SAM MERWIN, Jr. 




The house was furnished with all 
luxuries, including women. If if only 
had a lease that could be broken — 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




R OGER TENNANT, cross- 
ing the lawn, could see 
two of the three wings of 
the house, which radiated spoke- 
like from its heptagonal central 
portion. The wing on the left was 
white, with slim square pillars, 
reminiscent of scores of movie sets 
of the Deep South. That on the 
right was sundeck solar-house 
living-machine modern, something 
like a montage of shoeboxes. The 
wing hidden by the rest of the 
house was, he knew, spired, gabled 
and multicolored, like an ancient 



building in pre-Hitler Cracow. 

Dana was lying under a tree 
near the door, stretched out on a 
sort of deck chair with her eyes 
closed. She wore a golden gown, 
long and close-fitting and slit up 
the leg like the gown of a Chinese 
woman. Above it her comely face 
was sullen beneath its sleek cocoon 
of auburn hair. 

She opened her eyes at his ap- 
proach and regarded him with 
nothing like favor. Involuntarily 
^ie glanced down at the tartan 
shorts that were his only garment 
fo make sure that they were on 
properly. They were. He had 
thought them up in a moment of

utter boredom and they were ex- 
tremely comfortable. However, the 
near-Buchanan tartan did not 
crease or even wrinkle when he 
moved. Their captors had no idea 
of how a woven design should be- 
have. 

"Waiting for me?” Tennant 
a&ed the girl. 

She said, "I'd rather be dead. 
Maybe I ami Maybe’ we' re all dead 
and this is Hell.” 

He stood over her and looked 
down until she turned away her 
reddening face. He said, "So it's 
going to be you again, Dana. 
You'll be the first to come back 
for a second run.” 

"Don't flatter yourself,” she re- 
plied angrily. She sat up, pushed 
back her hair, got to her feet a 
trifle awkwardly because of the 
tight-fitting tubular gown. "If I 
could do anything about it . .” 
"But you can’t," he told her. 
"They’re too clever.” 

"Is this crop rotation or did 
you send for me?” she asked cyn- 
ically. "If you did, I wish you 
hadn’t. You haven’t asked about 
your son.” 

"T don’t even want to think 
about him,” said Tennant. "Let’s 
get on with it.” He could sense the 
restless stirring of the woman 
within Dana, just as he could feel 
the stirring toward her within 
himself — desire that both of them 
loathed because it was implanted 
within them by their captors. 

They walked toward the house. 



I T DIDN’T look like a prison — 
or a cage. Within the dome of 
the barrier, it looked more like a 
well-kept if bizarre little country 
estate. There was clipped lawn, a 
scattering of trees, even a clear 
little brook that chattered unend- 
ing annoyance at the small stones 
which impeded its flow. 

But the lawn was not of grass — 
it was of a bright green substance 
that might have been cellophane 
but wasn’t, and it sprouted from a 
fabric that might have been canvas 
but was something else. The trees 
looked like trees, only their trunks 
were bark all the way through — 
except that it was not bark. The 
brook was practically water, but 
the small stones over which it 
flowed were of no earthly mineral. 

They entered the house, which 
had no roof, continued to move 
beneath a sky that glowed with 
light which did not come from a 
sun or moon. It might have been 
a well-kept if bizarre little country 
estate, but it wasn’t. It was a 
prison, a cage. 

The other two women were sit- 
ting in the heptagonal central hall. 
Eudalia, who had borne twin girls 
recently, was lying back, newly 
thin and dark of skin and hair, 
smoking a scentless cigaret. A tall 
woman, thirtyish, she wore a sort 
of shimmering green strapless eve- 
ning gown. Tennant wondered 
how she maintained it in place, for 
despite her recent double mother- 
hood, she was almost flat of 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bosom. He asked her how she was 
feeling. 

"Okay, 1 guess,” she said. "The 
way they manage it, there’s noth- 
ing to it.” She had a flat, poten- 
tially raucous voice. Eudalia had 
been a female foreman in a gar- 
ment-cutting shop before being 
captured and brought through. 

"Good,” he said. "Glad to hear 
it.” He felt oddly embarrassed. He 
turned to Olga, broad, blonde and 
curiously vital, who sat perfectly 
still, regarding him over the preg- 
nant swell of her dirndl-clad waist. 
Olga had been a waitress in a 
. mining town hash-house near 
Scranton. 

Tennant wanted to put an en- 
couraging hand on her shoulder, 
to say something that might cheer 
her up, for she was by far the 
youngest of the three female cap- 
tives, barely nineteen. But with 
the eyes of the other two, espe- 
cially Dana, upon him, he could 
not. 

"I guess I wasn't cut out to be 
a Turk,” he said. "I don't feel at 
ease in a harem, even when it’s 
supposedly my own.” 

"You’re not doing so badly,” 
Dana replied acidly. 

"Lay off — he can’t help it,” said 
Eudalia unexpectedly. "He doesn’t 
like it any better than we do." 
i "But he doesn’t have to — have 
them,” objected Olga. She had a 
trace of 'Polish accent that was not 
unpleasant. In fact, Tennant 
thought, only her laughter was 



unpleasant, a shrill, uncontrolled 
burst of staccato sound that jarred 
him to his heels. Olga had not 
laughed of late, however. She was 
too frightened. 

«T 'ET’S get the meal ordered,” 

-I — i said Dana and they were all 
silent, thinking of what they 
wanted to eat but would not enjoy 
when it came. Tennant finished 
with his order, then got busy with 
his surprise. 

It arrived before the meal, 
materializing against one of the 
seven walls of the roofless cham- 
ber. It was a large cabinet on 
slender straight legs that resem- 
bled dark polished wood. Tennant 
went to it, opened a hingeless door 
and pushed a knob on the inner 
surface. At once the air was hide- 
ous with the acerate harmony of a 
singing commercial. 

... so go soak your head, 
be it gold, brown or red, 
in Any-tone Shampoo! 

A disc jockey’s buoyant tones 
cut in quickly as the final ooooo 
faded. "This is Grady Martin, 
your old night-owl, coming to you 
with your requests over Station 
WZZX, Manhattan. Here’s a wire 
from Theresa McManus and the 
gifls in the family entrance of 
Conaghan’s Bar and Grill on 
West . .” 

Tennant watched the girls as a 
sweet-voiced crooner began to ply 



JUDAS RAM

an unfamiliar love lyric to a melo- 
dy whose similarity to a thousand 
predecessors doomed it to instant 
success. 

Olga sat up straight, her pale 
blue eyes round with utter disbe- 
lief. She looked at the radio, at 
Tennant, at' the other two women, 
then 'back at the machine. She 
murmured something in Polish 
that was inaudible, but her expres- 
sion showed that it must have been 
wistful. 

Eudalia grinned at Tennant and, 
rising, did a sort of tap dance to 
the music, then whirled back into 
her chair, green dress ashimmer, 
and sank into it just to listen. 

Dana stood almost in the center 
of the room, carmine-tipped fin- 
gers clasped beneath the swell of 
her breasts. She might have been 
listening to Brahms or Debussy. 
Her eyes glowed with the salty 
brilliance of emotion and she was 
almost beautiful. 

"Rog!” she cried softly when 
the music stopped. "A radio and 
WZZX! 'Is it— are they— real?” 

"As real as you or I,” he told 
her. "It took quite a bit of doing, 
getting them to put a set together. 
And I wasn’t sure that radio would 
get through. TV doesn’t seem 
to. Somehow it brings things 
closer. 

Olga got up quite suddenly, 
went to the machine and, after 
frowning at it for a moment, tuned 
in another station from which a 
Polish-speaking announcer was 

34 



followed by polka music. She 
leaned against the wall, resting one 
smooth forearm on the top of the 
machine. Her eyes closed and she 
swayed a little in time to the polka 
beat. 

T ENNANT caught Dana look- 
ing at him and there was near 
approval in her expression — ap- 
proval that faded quickly as soon 
as she caught his gaze upon her. 
The food arrived then and they 
sat down at the round table to eat 
it. 

Tennant’s meat looked like 
steak, it felt like steak, but, lack- 
ing the aroma of steak, it was al- 
most tasteless. This was so with 
all of their foods, with their ciga- 
rets, with everything in their prison 
— or their cage. Their captors were 
utterly without a human concep- 
tion of smell, living, apparently, 
in a world without odor at all. 

Dana said suddenly, "I named 
the boy Tom, after somebody I 
hate almost as much as I hate you.” 
Eudalia laid down her fork with 
a clatter and regarded Dana dis- 
approvingly. "Why take it out on 
Rog?” she asked bluntly. "He 
didn’t ask to come here any more 
than we did. He’s got a wife back 
home. Maybe you want him to fall 
in love with you? Maybe you’re 
jealous because he doesn’t? Well, 
maybe be can’t! And maybe it 
wouldn't work, the way things are 
arranged here.” 

"Thanks, Eudalia,” said Ten- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nant. "I think I can defend my- 
self. But she’s right, Dana. We’re 
as helpless as — laboratory ani- 
mals. They have the means to 
make us do whatever they want.” 
"Rog,” said Dana, looking sud- 
denly scared, "I'm sorry I snapped 
at you. I know it’s not your fault. 
I’m — changing.” 

He shook his head. "No, Dana, 
you’re not changing. You’re adapt- 
ing. We all are. We seem to be in 
a universe of different properties 
as well as different dimensions. 
We’re adjusting. I can do a thing 
or two myself that seem absolute- 
ly impossible.” 

"Are we really in the fourth di- 
mension?” Dana asked. Of the 
three of them, she alone had more 
than a high-school education. 

"We may be in the eleventh for 
all I know,” he told her. "But I’ll 
settle for the fourth — a fourth di- 
mension in space, if that makes 
scientific sense, because we don’t 
seem to have moved in time. 1 
wasn’t sure of that, though, till we 
got the radio.” 

"Why haven’t they brought more 
of us through?” Eudalia asked, 
tamping out ashes in a tray that 
might have been silver. 

"I’m not sure,” he said thought- 
fully. "I think it’s hard for them. 
They have a hell of a time bring- 
ing anyone through alive, and late- 
ly they haven’t brought anyone 
through — not alive.” 

"Why do they do it — the other 
way, I mean?” asked Dana. 



Tennant shrugged. ”1 don't 
know. I’ve been thinking about it. 
I suppose it’s because they’re 
pretty human.” 

''Human!” Dana was outraged. 
"Do you call it human to — ” 
"Hold on,” he said. "They pass 
through their gateway to Earth at 
considerable danger and, probably, 
expense of some kind. Some of 
them don’t come back. They kill 
those of us who put up a fight. 
Those who don’t — or can’t — they 
bring back with them. Live or 
dead, we’re just laboratory speci- 
mens.” 

"Maybe,” Eudalia conceded 
doubtfully. Then her eyes blazed. 
"But the things they do — stuffing 
people, mounting their heads, keep- 
ing them on display in their — • 
their whatever they live in. You 
call that human, iRog?” 

"Were you ever in a big-game 
hunter’s trophy room?” Tennant 
asked quietly. "Or in a Museum of 
Natural History? A zoo? A nat- 
uralist’s lab? Or even, maybe, 
photographed as a baby on a bear- 
skin rug?” 

”1 was,” said Olga. "But that’s 
not the same thing.” 

"Of course not,” he agreed. "In 
the one instance, we’re the hunters, 
the breeders, the trophy collectors. 
In | the other” — he shrugged — 

we're the trophies.” 

iai 1 r 

HERE was a long silence. They 
finished eating and then Dana 
stood up and said, "I’m going out

on the lawn for a while.” She un- 
zipped her golden gown, stepped 
out of it to reveal a pair of tartan 
shorts that matched his, and. a 
narrow halter. 

"You thought those up while we 
ate,’’ he said. It annoyed him to be 
copied, though he did not know 
why. She laughed at him silently, 
tossed her auburn hair back from 
her face and went out of the roof- 
less house, holding the gold dress 
casually over her bare arm. 

Eudalia took him to the nursery. 
He was irritated now in another, 
angrier way. The infants, protect- 
ed by cellophane-like coverlets, 
were asleep. 

"They never cry,” the thin wo- 
man told him. "But they grow — 
God, how they grow!” 

"Good,” said Tennant, fighting 
down his anger. He kissed her, 
held her close, although neither of 
them felt desire at the moment. 
Their captors had seen to that; it 
wasn't Eudalia’s turn. Tennant said, 
"I wish I could do something about 
this. I hate seeing Dana so bitter 
and Olga so scared. It isn’t their 
fault.” 

"And it’s not yours,” insisted 
Eudalia. "Don’t let them make you 
think it is.” 

"I’ll try not to,” he said and 
stopped, realizing the family party 
was over. He had felt the inner 
tug of command, said good-by to 
the women and returned to his 
smaller compound within its own 
barrier dome. 

38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Then tame the invisible aura of 
strain in the air, the shimmering 
illusion of heat that was not heat, 
that was prelude to his teleporta- 
tion ... if that were the word. It 
was neither pleasant nor unpleas- 
ant; it was, that was all. 

He called it the training hall, 
not because it looked like a train- 
ing hall but because that was its 
function. It didn't actually look 
like anything save some half-nour- 
ished dream a surrealist might 
have discarded as too nightmarish 
for belief. 

As in all of this strange uni- 
verse, excepting the dome-cages in 
which the captives were held, the 
training hall followed no rules of 
three-dimensional space. One wall 
looked normal for perhaps a third 
of its length, then it simply wasn’t 
for a bit. It came back farther on 
at an impossible angle. Yet, walk- 
ing along it, touching it, it felt 
perfectly smooth and continuously 
straight. • 

The opposite wall resembled a 
diagonal cross-section of an 
asymmetrical dumbbell — that was 
the closest Tennant could come to 
it in words. And it, too, felt 
straight. The floor looked like 
crystal smashed by some cosmic 
impact, yet it had reason. He 
knew this even though no reason 
was apparent to his three-dimen- 
sional vision. The ceiling, where 
hq could see it, was beyond de- 
scription. 

The captor Tennant called 



JUDAS RAM 



39 



Opal came in through a far corner 
of the ceiling. He — if it was a he 
— was not large, although this, 
Tennant knew, meant nothing; 
Opal might extend thousands of 
yards in some unseen direction. He 
had no regular shape and much 
of him was iridescent and shot 
with constantly changing colors. 
Hence the name Opal. 

Communication was telepathic. 
Tennant could have yodeled or 
yelled or sung Mississippi Mud 
and Opal would have shown no 
reaction. Yet Tennant suspected 
that the captors could hear some- 
where along the auditory scale, just 
as perhaps they could smell, al- 
though not in any human sense. 

You {will approach without use 
of your appendages. 

The command was as clear as if 
it had been spoken aloud. Tennant 
took a deep breath. He thought 
of the space beside Opal. It took 
about three seconds and he was 
there, having spanned a distance 
of some ninety feet. He was get- 
ting good at it. 

Dog does trick, he thought. 

H E WENT through the entire 
routine at Opal’s bidding. 
When at last he was allowed to 
relax, he wondered, not for the 
first time, if he weren’t mastering 
some of the alleged Guru arts. At 
once he felt probing investigation. 
Opal, like the rest of the captors, 
was as curious as a cat — or a hu- 
man being. 

40 



Tennant sat against a wall, 
drenched with sweat. There would 
be endless repetition before his 
workout was done. On Earth, dogs 
were said to be intellectually two- 
dimensional creatures. He won- 
dered if they felt this helpless fu- 
tility when their masters taught 
them to heel, to point, to retrieve. 

Some days later, the training 
routine was broken. He felt a 
sudden stir of near-sick excitement 
as he received the thought: 

Now you are ready. We are go- 
ing through at last. 

Opal was nervous, so much so 
that he revealed more than he in- 
tended. Or perhaps that was his 
intent; Tennant could never be 
sure. They were going through to 
Tennant’s own dimension. He 
wondered briefly just what his 
role was to be. 

He had little time to speculate 
before Opal seemed to envelop 
him. There was the blurring 
wrench of forced teleportation 
and they were in another room, a 
room which ended in a huge irreg- 
ular passage that might have been 
the interior of a giant concertina — 
or an old-fashioned kodak. 

He stood before a kidney-shaped 
object over whose jagged surface 
colors played constantly. From 
Opal’s thoughts it appeared to be 
some sott of ultradimensional tele- 
vision set, but to Tennant it was 
as incomprehensible as an oil 
painting to an animal. 

Opal was annoyed that Tennant 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could make nothing of it. Then 
came the thought: 

What cover must your body 
have not to be conspicuous? 

Tennant wondered, cynically, 
what would happen if he were to 
demand a costume of mediaeval 
motley, complete with Pied Piper’s 
flute. He received quick reproof 
that made his' head ring as from a 
blow. 

He asked Opal where and when 
they were going, was informed 
that he would soon emerge on 
Earth where he had left it. That 
told him everything but; the date 
and season. Opal, like the rest of 
the captors, seemed to have no 
understanding of time in a human 
sense. 

Waiting, Tennant tried not to 
think of his wife, of the fact that 
he hadn’t seen her in — was it more 
than a year and a half on Earth? 
He could have controlled his heart- 
beat with one of his new powers, 
but that might have made Opal 
suspicious. He should be somewhat 
excited. He allowed himself to be, 
though he obscured the reasons. 
He was going to see his wife 
again . and maybe he could 
trick his way into not returning. 

* * * 

fTVHE maid who opened the door 
-L for him was new, although 
her eyes were old. But she recog- 
nized him and stood aside to let 
him enter. There must, he 



thought, still be pictures of him 
around. He wondered how Agatha 
could afford a servant. 

"Is Mrs. Tennant in?” he asked. 

She shook her head and fright 
made twin stoplights of the rouge 
on her cheeks as she shut the door 
behind him. He went into the liv- 
ing room, directly to the long sil- 
ver cigaret box on the coffee table, 
ft was proof of homecoming to fill 
his lungs with smoke he could 
smell. He took another drag, saw 
the maid still in the doorway, star- 
ing. 

"There’s no need for fright,” he 
told her. "I believe I still own 
this house.” Then, "When do you 
expect Mrs. Tennant?” 

"She just called. She’s on her 
way home from the club.” 

Still looking frightened, she de- 
parted for the rear of the house. 
Tennant stared after her puzzled- 
ly until the kitchen door swung 
shut behind her. The club? What 
club ? 

He shrugged, returned to the 
feeling of comfort that came from 
being back here, about to see 
Agatha again, hold her close in no 
more than a few minutes. And 
stay, his mind began to add 
eagerly, but he pushed the thought 
down where Opal could not detect 
it. 

He took another deep, lung- 
filling drag on his cigaret, looked 
around the room that was so im- 
portant a part of his life. The three 
women back there would be in a 



JUDAS RAM 



41 



ghastly spot. He felt like a heel 
for wanting to leave them there, 
then knew that he would try some- 
how to get them out. Not, of 
course, anything that would en- 
danger his remaining with Agatha; 
the only way his captors would 
get him back would be as a taxi- 
dermist’s specimen. 

He realized, shocked and scared, 
that his thoughts of escape had 
slipped past his mental censor, and 
he waited apprehensively for Opal 
to strike. Nothing happened and 
he warily relaxed. Opal wasn't 
tapping his thoughts. Because he 
felt sure of his captive ... or be- 
cause he couldn’t on Earth? 

It was like being let out of a 
cage. Tennant grinned at the book- 
case; the ebony-and-ivory elephants 
that Agatha had never liked were 
gone, but he’d get them back or 
another pair. The credenza had 
been replaced by a huge and ugly 
television console. That, he re- 
solved, would go down in the 
cellar rumpus room, where its 
bleached modernity wouldn’t clash 
with the casual antiquity of the 
living room. 

Agatha would complain, natu- 
rally, but his being back would 
make up for any amount of furni- 
ture shifting. He imagined her 
standing dose to him, her lovely 
fac6 lifted to be kissed, and his 
heart lurched like an adolescent’s. 
This hunger was real, not im- 
planted. Everything would be real 
... his love for her, the food he 



ate, the things he touched, his 
■house, his life. 

Your wife and a man are ap- 
proaching the house. 

The thought message from Opal 
crumbled his illusion of freedom. 
He sank down in a chair, trying to 
refuse to listen to the rest of the 
command: 

You are to bring the man 
through the gateway with you. We 
want another live male. 

T ENNANT shook his head, stiff 
and defiant in his chair. The 
punishment, when it came, was 
more humiliating than a slap across 
a dog's snout. Opal had been too 
interested in the next lab specimen 
to bother about his thoughts — that 
was why he had been free to think 
of escape. 

Tennant closed his eyes, willed 
himself to the front window. Now 
that he had mastered teleportation, 
it was incredible how much easier 
it was in his own world. He had 
covered the two miles from the 
gateway to the house in a mere 
seven jumps, the distance to the 
window in an instant. But there 
was no pleasure in it, only a con- 
firmation of his captor’s power over 
him. 

He was not free of them. He 
understood all too well what they 
wanted him to do; he was to play 
the Judas goat ... or rather the 
Judas ram, leading another victim 
to the fourth-dimensional pen. 
Grim, he watched the swoop of

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



headlights in the driveway and re- 
turned to the coffee table, lit a 
fresh cigarette. 

The front door was flung open 
and his diaphragm tightened at the 
remembered sound of Agatha’s 
throaty laugh . and tightened 
further when it was followed by a 
deeper rumbling laugh. Sudden 
fear made the cigarette shake in his 
fingers. 

"... Don’t be such a stuffed- 
shirt, darling.’’ Agatha’s mocking 
sweetness rang alarm-gongs in Ten- 
nant’s memory. "Charley wasn’t 
making a grab for me. He’d had 
one too many and only wanted a 
little fun. Really, darling, you seem 
to think that a girl . 

Her voice faded out as she saw 
Tennant standing there. She was 
wearing a white strapless gown, 
had a blue-red-and-gold Mandarin 
jacket slung hussar-fashion over her 
left shoulder. She looked even 
sleeker, better groomed, more as- 
sured than his memory of her. 

"I’m no stuffed-shirt and you 
know it." Cass’ tone was peevish. 
"But your idea of fun, Agatha, is 
pretty damn . .” 

It was his turn to freeze. Unbe- 
lieving, Tennant studied his suc- 
cessor. Cass Gordon — the man, the 
ex-halfback whose bulk was be- 
ginning to get out of hand, but 
whose inherent aggressive grace 
had not yet deserted him. The 
man, that was all — unless one 
threw in .the little black mustache 
and the smooth salesman’s manner. 



"You know, Cass,” Tennant said 
quietly, "I never for a moment 
dreamed it would be you.” 

"Roger'" Agatha found her 
voice. "You’re alive!” 

"Roger,” repeated Tennant vi- 
ciously. He felt sick with disgust. 
Maybe he should have expected a 
triangle, but somehow he hadn’t. 
And here it was, with all of them 
going through their paces like a trio- 
of tent-show actors. He said, "For 
God’s sake, sit down.” 

Agatha did so hesitantly. Her 
huge dark eyes, invariably clear and 
limpid no matter how much she 
had drunk, flickered toward him 
furtively. She said defensively, "I 
had detectives looking for you for 
six months. Where have you been, 
Rog? Smashing up the car like that 
and — disappearing! I’ve been out 
of my mind.” 

"Sorry," said Tennant. "I’ve had 
my troubles, too.” Agatha was 
scared stiff — of him. Probably with 
reason. He looked again at Cass 
Gordon and found that he sud- 
denly didn’t care. She couldn’t say 
it was loneliness. Women have 
waited longer than eighteen 
months. He would have if his cap- 
tors had let him. 

"Where in hell have you been, 
Rog?” Gordon’s tone was almost 
parental. "I don’t suppose it’s news 
to you, but there was a lot of sus- 
picion directed your way while that 
crazy killer was operating around 
here. Agatha and I managed to 
clear you.”

"Decent of you,” said Tennant. 
He got up, crossed to the cabinet 
that served as a bar. It was fully 
equipped — with more expensive 
liquor, he noticed, than he had 
ever been able to afford. He poured 
a drink of brandy, waited for the 
others to fill their glasses. 

A GATHA looked at him over 
ithe rim of hers. "Tell us, 
Rog. We have a right to know. T 
do, anyway.” 

"One question first,” he said. 
"What about those killings? Have 
there been any lately?” 

"Not for over a year,” Cass told 
him. "They never did get the devil 
who skinned those bodies and re- 
moved the heads.” 

So, Tennant thought, they hadn’t 
used the gateway. Not since they 
had brought the four of them 
through, not since they had begun 
to train him for his Judas ram 
duties. 

Agatha was asking him if he had 
been abroad. 

"In a way,” he replied unemo- 
tionally. "Sorry if I've worried you, 
Agatha, but my life has been rather 
— indefinite, since I — left.” 

He was standing no more than 
four inches from this woman he 
had desired desperately for six 
years, and he no longer wanted 
her. He was acutely conscious of 
her perfume. It wrapped them both 
like an exotic blanket, and it re- 
pelled him. He studied the firm 
clear flesh of her cheek and chin. 



the arch of nostril, the carmine 
fullness of lower lip, the swell of 
bosom above low-cut gown. And he 
no longer wanted any of it or of 
her. Cass Gordon — 

It didn’t have to be anybody at 
all. For it to be Cass Gordon was 
revolting. 

"Rog,” she said and her voice 
trembled, "what are we going to 
do? What do you want to do?” 
Take her back? He smiled iron- 
ically; she wouldn’t know what that 
meant. It would serve her right, but 
maybe there was another way. 

"I don’t know about you,” he 
said, "but I suspect we’re in the 
same boat. I also have other in- 
terests.” 

"You louse!” said Cass Gordon, 
arching rib cage and nostrils. "If 
you try to make trouble for Agatha, 
I can promise . 

"What can you promise?” de- 
manded Tennant. When Gordon’s 
onset subsided in mumbles, he 
added, "Actually, I don’t think I'm 
capable of making more than a 
fraction of the trouble for either of 
you that you both are qualified to 
make for yourselves.” 

He lit a cigarette, inhaled. "Re- 
lax. I’m not planning revenge. 
After this evening, I plan to vanish 
for good. Of course, Agatha, that 
offers you a minor nuisance. You 
will have to wait six years to marry 
Cass — seven years if the maid who 
let me in tonight talks. That’s the 
law, isn’t it, Cass? You probably 
had it all figured out.” 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"You bastard," said Cass. "You 
dirty bastard! You know what a 
wait like that could do to us.” 
"Tristan and Isolde,” said Ten- 
nant, grinning almost happily. 
"Well, I’ve had my little say. Now 
I’m off again. Cass, would you give 
me a lift? I have a conveyance of 
sorts a couple of miles down the 
road.” 

H E NEEDED no telepathic 
powers to read the thoughts 
around him then. He heard Aga- 
tha’s quick intake of breath, saw the 
split-second look she exchanged 
with Cass. He turned away, know- 
ing that she was imploring her 
lover to do something, anything, as 
long as it was safe. 

Deliberately, Tennant poured 
himself a second drink. This might 
be easier and pleasanter than he 
had expected. They deserved some 
of the suffering he had had and 
there was a chance that they might 
get it. 

Tennant knew now why he was 
the only male_ human the captors 
had been able to take alive. Ap- 
parently, thanks to the rain-slick 
road, he had run the sedan into a 
tree at the foot of the hill beyond 
the river. He had been sitting there, 
unconscious, ripe fruit on their 
doorstep. They had simply picked 
him up. 

Otherwise, apparently, men were 
next to impossible for them to 
capture. All they could do was kill 
them and bring back their heads 



and hides as trophies. With women 
it was different — perhaps the cap- 
tors’ weapons, whatever they were, 
worked more efficiently on females. 
A difference in body chemistry or 
psychology, perhaps. 

More than once, during his long 
training with Opal, Tennant had 
sent questing thoughts toward his 
captor, asking why they didn’t sim- 
ply set up the gateway in some 
town or city and take as many hu- 
mans as they wanted. 

Surprisingly there had been a 
definite fear reaction. As nearly as 
he could understand, it had been 
like asking an African pygmy, 
armed with a blowgun, to set up 
shop in the midst of a herd of 
wild elephants. It simply wasn’t 
feasible — and furthermore he de- 
rived an impression of the tenuosity 
as well as the immovability of the 
gateway itself. 

They could be hurt, even killed 
by humans in a three-dimensional 
world. How? Tennant did not 
know. Perhaps as a man can cut 
finger or even throat on the edge 
of a near-two-dimensional piece of 
paper. It took valor for them to 
hunt men in the world of men. "In 
that fact lay a key to their char- 
acter — if such utterly alien creatures 
could be said to have character. 

C ASS GORDON was smiling at 
him, saying something about 
one for the road. Tennant accepted 
only because it was luxury to drink 
liquor that smelled and tasted as 



JUDAS RAM 



45 



liquor should. He raised his glass 
to Agatha, said, "I may turn up 
again, but it’s unlikely, so have 
yourself a time, honey.” 

"Oh, Rog!” said Agatha and 
her eyes were fraudulently wet. 
Tennant felt pure contempt. She 
knew that Cass intended to try to 
kill him — and she couldn't play 
it straight. She had to ham it up 
with false emotion, even though 
she had silently pleaded with her 
lover to do something, anything. 
He put down his empty glass. The 
thought that he had spent eighteen 
months yearning for this she- 
Smithfield like a half-damp puppy 
made him almost physically ill. 

"You’ll make out,” he told her 
with savage sincerity. In her way, 
in accord with her desires, Agatha 
would. At bottom she was, he 
realized, as primitive, as realistic, 
as the three who waited beyond 
the gateway. An ex-waitress, an 
ex-forewoman, an ex-model of 
mediocre success — and Agatha. He 
tried to visualize his wife as a 
member of his involuntary harem 
■and realized that she would adapt 
as readily as the other women. But 
he didn’t want her. 

He turned away and said, 
"Ready, Cass?” 

"Right with you,” the ex-half- 
back replied, hurrying toward the 
hall. Tennant considered, took an- 
other drink for his own road. The 
signals had been given, the game 
was being readied. He had no wish 
to upset the planning, h^e had 



some plans also, and theirs gave 
his enough moral justification to 
satisfy his usually troublesome 
conscience. 

Agatha put her arms around his 
neck. She was warm and soft and 
moist of lip and playing her part 
with obvious enjoyment of its 
bathos. She murmured, "I’m so 
sorry, Rog, darling — ” 

"Cut!” he said almost in a snarl 
and wrenched free. He brought 
out a handkerchief — he had re- 
membered to have one created, 
praise Allah — and rubbed lip- 
stick from his face. He tossed the 
handkerchief to Agatha. 

"You might have this analyzed,” 
he told her lightly. "It could be 
interesting. The handkerchief, 
not the lipstick.” 

"I'm glad you're going!” she 
blazed, although her voice was 
low. "I'm glad you’re going. I 
hope you never come back.” 
"That,” he told her, "makes 
exactly two of us. Have fun.” 

He went out into the hall, where 
Cass was waiting, wearing what 
was intended to be a smile. They 
went out to the car together — it 
was a big convertible— and Cass 
got behind the wheel. He said, 
"Where to, old man?” 

"The Upham Road,” said Ten- 
nant, feeling nothing at all. 

C ASS got the car under way 
and Tennant sensed them 
coming through. They warned 
him that his chauffeur was carry- 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing a weapon concealed in an in- 
side pocket. 

As if I didn’t know! Tennant 
snapped back at them. 

Cass tried to drive him past the 
spot beyond the bridge where the 
gateway lay hidden in its armor of 
invisibility. He evidently planned 
to go miles from the house before 
doing whatever he had decided to 
do. 

Tennant thought he knew. It 
would involve riding the back 
roads like this one for fifteen or 
twenty miles, perhaps farther. He 
suspected that the quarry pond in 
South Upham was his intended 
destination. There would be 
plenty of loose rock handy with 
which to weigh down his body 
before dumping it into the water. 

If it were recovered, Cass and 
Agatha could alibi one another. 
In view of his earlier disappear- 
ance, this would be simple. Of 
course there was the maid, but 
Cass had enough money and 
smooth talk to manage that angle. 
They could undoubtedly get away 
with killing him. 

"Stop,” said Tennant, just 
across the bridge. 

"What for?” Cass countered 
and Tennant knew it was time to 
act. He wrenched the key _from 
the ignition switch, tossed it out 
of the car. Cass braked, de- 
manded, "What in hell did you do 
that for?" 

"I get out here,” Tennant said. 
"You didn’t stop.” 



"Okay, if that’s the way you 
want it.” Cass' heavy right hand, 
the little black hairs on its back 
clearly visible in the dashboard 
light, moved toward his inside 
pocket. 

Tennant teleported to the side 
of the road, became a half-visible 
shade against the darkness of the 
trees. He felt Opal’s excitement 
surge through his brain, knew that 
from then on his timing would 
have to be split-second perfect. 

It seemed to him as if all the 
inchoate thoughts, all the vague 
theories, all the half-formed plans 
of more than a year had crystal- 
ized. For the first time since his 
capture, he not only knew what he 
wanted to do — but saw the faint 
glimmer of a chance of doing it 
successfully. 

He was going to try to lead 
Cass to the gateway, maneuver him 
inside — and then escape. They 
wouldn’t get Tennant; the power 
of teleportation they themselves, 
had given him would keep him 
from being captured again. It 
would work. He was sure of it. 
They’d have their male specimen 
and he’d be free . not to go 
back to Agatha, because he 
wouldn’t, but to help the three 
women to get back, too. 

C ASS was plunging after him 
now, pistol in hand, shout- 
ing. Tennant could have him 
killed now, have him flayed and 
decapitated as other male victims

had been. Opal might even give 
him the hide as a reward after it 
was treated. Some Oriental poten- 
tate, Tennant reflected, might rel- 
ish having his wife’s lover as a 
rug on his living room floor. Ten- 
nant preferred the less operatic 
revenge of leaving Cass and 
Agatha alive to suffer. 

.He teleported farther into the 
trees, closer to the gateway, plot- 
ting carefully his next moves. Cass 
was crashing along, cursing in 
frustration. 

"Stand still, damn you! You 
shift around like a ghost!” 

Tennant realized with sudden 
terror that Cass might give up, 
unable to solve his prey's abrupt 
appearances and disappearances. 
He needed encouragement to keep 
him going. 

Jeeringly, Tennant paused, 
simultaneously thumbed his nose 



and stuck out his tongue at Cass. 
The scornful childishness of the 
gesture enraged Cass more than 
the worst verbal insult could have. 
He yelled his anger and firdd at 
Tennant. There was no way to 
miss, but Tennant was five yards 
farther on before the explosion 
ended. 

"Calm down,” he advised quiet- 
ly. "Getting mad always spoils 
your aim.” 

That, naturally, made Cass even 
angrier. He fired viciously twice 
more before Tennant reached the 
gateway, both times without a 
chance of hitting his elusive tar- 
get. 

Opal, Tennant discovered, was 
almost as frantic as Cass. He was 
deep inside the passage, jittering 
visibly in his excitement, in his 
anticipation of the most important 
bag his species had yet made on 




48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earth. And there was something 
else in his thoughts. 

Anxiety. Fear. The gateway was 
vulnerable to third-dimensional 
weapons. Where the concertina- 
like passage came into contact 
with Earth, there was a belt, per- 
haps a foot in width, which was 
spanned by some sort of force- 
webbing. Opal was afraid that a 
bullet might strike the webbing 
and destroy the gateway. 

Cass was getting closer. It 
would be so easy . keep tele- 
porting, bewilder him, let him 
make a grab . and then skip a 
hundred yards away just as the 
gateway shut. He would be out- 
side, Cass inside. 

And the three women? Leave 
them with Cass? Leave the gate- 
way open for more live or mount- 
ed specimens? 

Tennant concentrated on the 



zone of strain at the point of di- 
mensional contact, was there 
directly in front of it. Cass, curs- 
ing, lunged clear of the under- 
brush outside, saw Tennant there. 
Tennant was crouching low, not 
moving, staring mockingly at him. 
He lifted the automatic and fired. 

T ENNANT teleported by inches 
instead of yards, and so blood 
oozed from a graze on his left ear 
when he rejoined a shaken Opal 
in the world that knew no night. 
For a long time — how long," of 
course, he could not know — they 
stood and watched the gateway 
burn to globular ash in a dark 
brown fire that radiated searing 
cold. 

Opal was in trouble. An aura 
of anger, of grief, of accusation, 
surrounded him. Others of them 
came and for a while Tennant 




JUDAS RAM 



was forgotten. Then, abruptly, he 
was back in his own compound, 
walking toward the house. 

In place of his country Na- 
poleonic roll-bed, which he had 
visualized for manufacture with 
special care, Dana had substituted 
an immense modern sleeping de- 
vice that looked like a low hassock 
with a ten-foot diameter. She was 
on her knees, her back toward the 
door, fiddling with a radio. 

She heard him enter, said with- 
out turning, "It won’t work. Just 
a little while ago it stopped.” 

'T think we’re cut off now, per- 
haps for good,” he told her. He 
sat down on the edge of the ab- 
surd bed and began to take off the 
clothes they had given him for the 
hunt. He was too tired to protest 
against the massacre of his bed- 
room decor. He was not even sure 
he wanted to protest. For all its 
anachronism, the big round bed 
was comfortable. 

She watched him, her hands on 
her thighs, and there was worry 
written on her broad forehead. 
"You know something, Rog.” 

"I don’t know anything," he re- 
plied. ”1 only think and have 
theories.” Unexpectedly he found 
himself telling her all about it, 
about himself, where he had been, 
what he had done. 

She listened rjuietly, saying 
nothing, letting him go on. His 
head was in her lap and he talked 
up to her while she ran gentle fin- 
gers through his hair. When he 

50 



had finished, she smiled down at 
him thoughtfully, affectionately, 
then said, "You know, you’re a 
funny kind of man, Roger.” 
"Funny?” 

She cuffed him gently. "You 
know what I mean. So now we’re 
really cut off in this place — you 
and me and little Tom and Olga 
and Eudalia and the twins. What 
are we going to do, Roger?” 

He shrugged. He was very 
tired. "Whatever they’ll let us do,” 
he said through a yawn. "Maybe 
we can make this a two-way study. 
They are almost human, you 
know. Almost.” He pulled her 
down and kissed her and felt un- 
expected contentment decant 
through his veins. He knew now 
that things had worked out the 
right way, the only way. He added 
aloud, "I think we’ll find ways to 
keep ourselves amused.” 

"You really enjoy playing the 
heel, don’t you, Rog?” Her lips 
moved against his as she spoke. 
"You had a chance to get out of 
here. You could have changed 
places with Cass. Maybe you could 
have destroyed the gateway and 
stayed on the other side and still 
saved other victims. But no, you 
had to come back to — us. I think 
I’m going to be in love with you 
for that.” 

He sat up on one elbow and 
looked down at her half angrily. 
"Are you trying to make a goddam 
hero out of me?” he asked.

JAYWALKER 

BY ROSS ROCKLYNNE 



Women may be against progress because it means new 
pseudo-widowhoods. Space-widowhood, for instance... 



A T LAST she was on the 
gangplank, entering the 
.mouth of the spaceship — 
and nothing could ever stop her 
now. Not unless she broke down 
completely in front of all these 
hurrying, Moon-bound passengers, 
in plain sight of the scattered crowd 
which clustered on the other side 



of the space-field barriers. Even 
that possibility was denied her 
when two gently insistent middle 
aged ladies indicated she was block- 
ing the way. 

Somehow, dizzily, she was at her 
seat, led there by a smiling, brown- 
dad stewardess; and her azure 
tipped fingers were clutching at the 



JAYWALKER 



51 



pearl-gray plasta-leather of the 
chair arm. Her eyes, the azure of 
her nails, the azure (so she had 
been told) of Earth seen from in- 
terplanetary space, grew hot. She 
closed them, and for a moment 
gave herself up to an almost phys- 
ical yearning for the Toluca Lake 
house — the comfort, the safety, the 
— the sanity of it.. 

S TUBBORNLY she forced her- 
self back to reality. At any 
moment Jack, dark-eyed and 
scrappy, might come swinging 
down the long, shining aisle. Jack 
— Captain Jack McHenry, if you 
please — must not know, yet, what 
she was doing to patch up their 
marriage. 

She turned her face away from 
the aisle, covered her cheek with 
her hand to hide it. Her gaze went 
out through the ray-proof glass port 
to the field, to the laboring beetle 
of a red tractor bearing the gang- 
way on its busy back, to the low, 
blast-proof administration build- 
ing. When her gaze came to the 
tall sign over the entrance, she 
hurried it past; it was too late to 
think about that now, the square, 
shouting type that read: 

CAUTION 

HAVE YOU PASSED YOUR 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION? 
Avoiding It May Cost Your 
Life! 

"May I see your validation, 
please?” 



Marcia McHenry stiffened. Had 
she read the sign aloud ? She 
turned startled eyes up to the smil- 
ing stewardess, who was holding 
out a well-groomed hand. Marcia 
responded weakly to the smile, 
overcame a sudden urge to blurt 
out that she had no validation — 
not her own, anyway. But her stiff 
fingers were already holding out 
the pink card with Nellie Foster’s 
name on it. 

"You’re feeling well, Mrs. Fos- 
ter?” 

Feeling well? Yes, of course. 
Except for the — usual sickness. But 
that’s so very normal. Her 
numb lips moved. "I’m fine,” she 
said. 

Miss Eagen (which, her neat 
lapel button attested, was her 
name) made a penciled frown as 
lovely as her machined smile. 
"Some day,” she told Marcia, "we 
won’t have to ask the passengers 
if they're well. It’s so easy to come 
aboard on someone else’s valida- 
tion, and people don't seem to 
realize how dangerous that is.” 

As Miss Eagen moved to the 
next seat, Marcia shrank into a 
small huddle, fumbling with tjje 
card until it was crammed shape- 
less into her purse. Then from the 
depths of her guilt came rebellion. 
It was going to be all right. She 
was doing the biggest thing she’d 
ever done, and Jack would rise to 
the occasion, and it would be all 
right. 

It bad to be all right . 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



After this — if this didn’t work 
— there just would be nothing else 
she could do. She wasn’t a schem- 
ing woman. No one would ever 
know how difficult it had been for 
her to think up the whole plan, to 
find Nellie Foster (someone Jack 
had never met) and to persuade 
Nellie to register for the trip and 
take the physical for her. She’d 
had to lie to Nellie, to make Nellie 
think she was brave and adventur- 
ous, and that she was just doing it 
to surprise Jack. 

Oh, he’d be surprised, all right. 

The flash walls on the field were 
being raised to keep the blow-by 
from the ship’s jets from searing 
the administration building and the 
area beyond. Marcia realized with 
crushing suddenness that the ship 
was about to blast off in seconds. 
She half-rose, then sank back, bit- 
ing her lip. Silly . Jack had said 
that — her fear of space was silly. 
He'd said it during the quarrel, 
and he'd roared at her, "And that’s 
why you want me to come back — 
ground myself, be an Earth-lubber 
— so I can spare you the anguish 
of sitting home wondering if I’ll 
come back alive!” 

A ND then he’d been sorry he’d 
shouted, and he sat by her, 
taking her chin in his hand. "Mar- 
cia, Marcia,” he'd said gently, 
"you’re so silly! It’s been nineteen 
whole years since your father died 
in the explosion of a Moon-rocket. 
Rocket motors just don’t explode 



any more, honey! Ships travel to 
the Moon and back on iron-clad, 
mathematical orbits that are figured 
before the ship puffs a jet — ” 

"The Elsinore?” She'd said it 
viciously, to taunt him, and some- 
thing in her had been pleased at 
the dull flush that rose to his face. 
Everyone knew about the Elsinore, 
the 500-foot Moon-ferry that al- 
most missed the Moon. 

"That,” he said bitterly, "was 
human damnfoolishness botching 
up 'the equations. Too many lobby- 
ists have holdings on the Moon 
and don’t want to risk not being 
able to go there in a hurry. So 
they haven’t passed legislation to 
keep physically unfit people off 
spaceships. One of the passengers 
got aboard the Elsinore on some- 
body else’s validation — which 
meant that nobody knew he was 
taking endocrine treatments to put 
hair on his brainless head and re- 
store his — - Oh, the Jaywalker!” 
Jack spat in disgust. "Anyway, he 
was the kind of idiot who never 
realizes that certain glandular con- 
ditions are fatal in free fall.” 

Even now she distinctly recalled 
the beginnings of the interplanet- 
ary cold that always seeped into the 
warm house when he talked about 
space, when he was about to leave 
her for it. And this time it was 
worse than ever before. 

He went on remorselessly, 
"Once the Elsinore reached the 
free-fall flight, where power could 
be shut off, the skipper had to put 



JAYWALKER 



S3 



the ferry into an axial spin under 
power, creating artificial gravity to 
save the worthless life of that fool. 
So of course he lost his trajectory, 
and had to warp her in as best he 
could, without passing the Moon 
' or crashing into it. And of course 
you're not listening.” 

"It's all so dull!” she had flared, 
and then, "How can I be interest- 
ed in what some blundering space- 
jockey did?" 

"Blun — Marcia, you really don’t 
realize what that skipper did was 
the finest piece of shiphandling 
since mankind got off the ground." 

"Was it?” she’d yawned. "Could 
you do it?” 

"I — like to think I could,” he 
said. "I’d hate to have to try.” 
She’d shrugged. "Then it can’t 
be very difficult, darling.” 

She hadn’t meant to be so cruel. 
Or so stupid. But when they were 
quarreling, or when he talked that 
repugnant, dedicated, other-world 
garble, something always went cold 
and furious and — lonely inside her, 
and made her fight back unfairly. 

After he’d gone — for good, he 
said — her anger had sustained her 
for a few weeks. Then, bleakly, she 
knew she’d go to the ends of Earth 
for Jack. Or even to the Moon. 

OITTING rigid in the tense still- 
o ness of a rocket ship that was 
about to leap from Earth, Marcia 
started as an officer ducked his 
head into the passenger compart- 
ment from the pilot room’s deep 



glow. But it wasn’t Jack. The offi- 
cer’s lips moved hurriedly as he 
counted over the seats. He ducked 
back out of sight. From the bulk- 
heads, the overhead, everywhere, 
came a deep, quiet rumble. Some 
of the passengers looked anxious, 
seme excited, and some just leafed 
casually through magazines. 

Now the brown-clad Miss Eagen 
was speaking from the head of the 
aisle. 

"Those of you who haven’t been 
in a rocket before won’t find it 
much different from being in an 
airplane. At the same time — ” She 
paused, quiet brown eyes solemn. 
"What you are about to experience 
is something that will make you 
proud to belong to the human 
race.” 

That again! thought Marcia furi- 
ously; and then all emotion left 
her but cold, ravening fear as the 
rumble heightened. She tried to 
close her eyes, her ears against it, 
but her mind wouldn’t respond. 
She squirmed in her chair and 
found herself staring down at the 
field. It looked the way she felt — 
flat and pale and devoid of life, 
with a monstrous structure of ter- 
ror squatting in it. The scene was 
abruptly splashed with a rushing 
sheet of flame that darkened the 
daytime sky. Then it was torn from 
her vision. 

It was snatched away — the build- 
ings, the trees, the roads surround- 
ing the field seemed to pour in 
upon it, shrinking as they ran to- 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gether. Roads dried up like parched 
rivers, thinning and vanishing into 
the circle of her horrified vision. A 
great, soft, uniform weight pressed 
her down and back; she fought it, 
but it was too big and too soft. 

Now Earth’s surface was vague 
and Sun-splashed. Marcia's sense of 
loss tore at her. She put up her 
hands, heavily, and pressed the 
glass as if she could push it out, 
push herself out, go back, back to 
Earth and solidity. Clouds shot by 
like bullets, fell away until they 
were snowflakes roiling in violet 
haze. Then, in the purling universe 
that had grown around the ship. 
Earth was a mystic circle, a shallow 
dish floating darkly and heavily be- 
low. 

"We are now,” said Miss 
Eagen’s calm voice, "thirty-seven 
miles over Los Angeles.” 

After that, there was scarcely 
room for thought — even for fear, 
though it lurked nearby, ready to 
leap. There was the ascent, the 
quiet, sleeplike ascent into space. 
Marcia very nearly forgot to 
breathe. She had been prepared for 
almost anything except this quality 
of peace and awe. 

S HE didn’t know how long she 
had been sitting there, awe- 
struck, spellbound, when she real- 
ized that she had to finish the job 
she’d started, and do it right now, 
this minute. It might already be 
too late . she wished, suddenly, 
and for the very first time, that 



she’d paid more attention to Jack’s 
ramblings about orbits and turn- 
over points and correction blasts, 
and all that gobbledegook. She 
glanced outside again and the sky 
was no longer deep blue, but black. 
She pressed herself up out of the 
soft chair — it was difficult, because 
of the one-and-a-half gravities the 
ship was holding — and plodded 
heavily up the aisle. Miss Eagen 
was just rising from the chair in 
which she sat for the take-off. 

"Miss Eagen — ” 

"Yes, Mrs. Fos — why, what’s the 
matter?” 

Seeing the startled expression on 
the stewardess’ face, Marcia real- 
ized she must be looking like 3 
ghost. She put a hand to her cheek 
and found it clammy. 

"Come along,” said Miss Eagen 
cheerfully. She put a firm arm 
around Marcia’s shoulder. "Just a 
touch of space-sickness. This way. 
That’s it. We’ll have you fixed up 
in a jiffy.” 

"It isn’t s-space sickness,” said 
Marcia in a very small and very 
positive voice. She let herself be 
led forward, through the door and 
to the left, where there was a small 
and compact ship’s hospital. 

"Now, how,” said Miss Eagen 
briskly, "just you lie down there, 
Mrs. Foster. Does it hurt any spe- 
cial place?" 

Marcia lay down gratefully. She 
closed her eyes tightly and said, 
"I’m not Mrs. Foster. It doesn’t 
hurt.” 



JAYWALKER 



55 



"You’re not — ” Miss Eagen ap- 
parently decided to take one thing 
at a time. "How do you feel?” 

"Scared,” said Marcia. 

"Why, what-is there to be scared 
of?” 

“I’m pregnant.” 

"Well, that’s no — You’re 
what?” 

"I’m Mrs. McHenry. I’m Jack’s 
wife.” 

There was such a long pause that 
Marcia - opened her eyes. Miss 
Eagen was looking at her levelly. 
She said, "I’ll have to examine 
you." 

"I know. Go ahead.” 

, Miss Eagen did, swiftly and 
thoroughly. "You’re so right,” she 
breathed. She went to the small 
sink, stripping off her rubber 
gloves. With her back to Marcia, 
she said, "I’ll have to tell the cap- 
tain, you know.” 

"I know. I’d rather . tell him 
myself.” 

"Thanks,” said Miss Eagen flat- 
ly. Marcia felt as if she’d been 
slapped. Miss Eagen dried her 
hands and crossed to an intercom. 
"Eagen to Captain.” 

"McHenry here.” 

"Captain McHenry, could you 
come back to the hospital right 
away?” 

"Not right away, Sue.” Sue! No 
wonder he had found it so easy to 
Walk out! She looked at the trim 
girl with hating eyes. The intercom 
said, "You know I’ve got course- 
correction computations from here 



to yonder. Give me another forty 
minutes.” 

"I think,” said Sue Eagen into 
the mike, "that the computations 
can wait.” 

"The hell you do!” The red con- 
tact light on the intercom went 
out. 

"He’ll be right here,” said Miss 
Eagen. 

M ARCIA sat up slowly, clum- 
sily. Miss Eagen did not offer 
to help. Marcia’s hands strayed to 
her hair, patted it futilely. 

He came in, moving fast and 
purposefully, as always. "Sue, what 
in time do you think you — 
Marcia!” His dark face broke into 
a delighted grin and he put his 
arms out. "You — you’re here — 
here, on my ship!” 

"I’m pregnant, Jack,” she said. 
She put out a hand to ward him 
off. She couldn’t bear the thought 
of his realizing what she had done 
while he had his arms around her. 

"You are? You — we — ” He 
turned to Miss Eagen, who nodded 
once, her face wooden. "Just find 
it out?" 

This time Miss Eagen didn’t re- 
act at all, and Marcia knew that 
she had to speak up. "No, Jack. I 
knew weeks ago.” 

There was no describable change 
in his face, but the taut skin of his 
space-tanned cheek seemed, some- 
how, to draw inward. His eyebrow 
ridges seemed to be more prom- 
inent, and he looked older, and

very tired. Softly and slowly he 
asked, "What in God's name made 
you get on the ship?” 

“I had to, Jack. I had to.” 

"Had to kill yourself?” he de- 
manded brutally. "This tears it. 
This ties it up in a box with a 
bloody ribbon-bow. I suppose you 
know what this means — what I’ve 
got to do now?” 

"Spin ship,” she replied imme- 
diately, and looked up at him pert- 
ly, like a kindergarten child who 
knows she has the right answer. 
He groaned. 

"You said you could do it.” 

“I can . try," he said hollow- 
ly. "But — why, ivhy?” 

"Because,” she said bleakly, "I 
learned long ago that a man grows 
to love what he has to fight for.” 
"And you were going to make 
me fight for you and the child — 
even if the lives of a hundred and 
seventy people were involved?” 
"You said you could handle it. 
I thought you could.” 

"I'll try,” he said wearily. "Oh, 
I'll try.” He went out, dragging 
his feet, his shoulders down, with- 
out looking at her. 

There was a stiff silence. Marcia 
looked up at Miss Eagen. "It’s true, 
you know,” she said. "A man 
grows to love the things he has to 
defend, no matter how he felt 
about them before.” 

The stewardess looked at her, her 
face registering a strange mixture 
of detachment and wonder. "You 
really believe that, don’t you?” 



Marcia's patience snapped. "You 
don’t have to look so superior. I 
know what’s bothering you. Well, 
he’s my husband, and don’t you 
forget it.” 

M ISS EAGEN'S breath hissed 
in. Her eyes grew bright and 
she shook her head slightly. Then 
she turned on her heel and went 
to the intercom. Marcia thought for 
a frightened moment that she was 
going to call Jack back again. In- 
stead she dialed and said, "Hospi- 
tal to Maintenance. Petrucelli?” 
"Petrucelli here.” 

"Come up with a crescent 
wrench, will you. Pet?” 

Another stiff silence. A question 
curled into Marcia's mind and she 
asked it. "Do you work on all these 
ships at one time or another?” 
Miss Eagen did not beat around 
the bush. "I’ve been with Captain 
McHenry for three years. I hope to 
work with him always. I think he’s 
the finest in the Service.” 

"He — th-thinks as well of you, 
no doubt.” 

Petrucelli lounged in, a big man, 
easy-going, powerful. "What’s 
busted, muscles ?” 

"Bolt the bed to the bulkhead, 
Pet. Mrs. McHenry — I’m sorry, but 
you’ll have to get up.” 

Marcia bounced resentfully off 
the cot and stood aside. Petrucelli 
looked at her, cocked an eyebrow, 
looked at Miss Eagen, and asked, 
"Jaywalker?” 

"Please hurry, Pet.” She turned

to Marcia. 'Tve got to explain to 
the passengers that there won't be 
any free fall. Most of them are 
looking forward to it.” She went 
out. 

Marcia watched the big man 
work for a moment. "Why are you 
putting the bed on the wall?” 

He looked at her and away, 
quickly. "Because, lady, when we 
start to spin, that outside bulkhead 
is going to be down. Centrifugal 
force, see?” And before she could 
answer him he added, "I can’t talk 
and work at the same time.” 
Feeling very much put-upon, 
Marcia waited silently until he was 
finished, and the bed hung ludic- 
rously to the wall like a walking 
fly. She thanked him timidly, and 
he ignored it and went out. 

Miss Eagen returned. 

"That man was very rude,” said 
Marcia. 

Miss Eagen looked at her coolly. 
"I’m sorry,” she said, obviously not 
meaning sorry at all. 

Marcia wet her lips. "I asked you 
a question before,” she said even- 
ly. "About you and the captain.” 
"You did,” said Sue Eagen. 
"Please don’t.” 

"And why not?” 

"Because,” said Miss Eagen, and 
in that moment she looked almost 
as drawn as Jack had, "I’m sup- 
posed to be of service to the pas- 
sengers at all times no matter what. 
If I have feelings at all, part of my 
job is to keep them to myself.” 
"Very courteous, I’m sure. How- 



ever, I want to release you from 
ycur sense of duty. I’m most in- 
terested in what you have to say.” 
Miss Eagen’s arched nostrils 
seemed pinched and white. "You 
really want me to speak my 
piece?” 

I N ANSWER Marcia leaned back 
against the bulkhead and fold- 
ed her arms. Miss Eagen gazed at 
her for a moment, nodded as if to 
herself, and said, "I suppose there 
always will be people who don’t 
pay attention to the rules. Jaywalk- 
ers. But out here jaywalkers don’t 
have as much margin for error as 
they do crossing against a traffic 
light on Earth.” She looked Marcia 
straight in the eye. "What makes 
a jaywalker isn’t ignorance. It’s a 
combination of stupidity and stub- 
bornness. The jaywalker does know 
better. In your case ...” 

She sighed. "It’s well known — 
even by you — that the free-fall con- 
dition has a weird effect on certain 
people. The human body is in an 
unprecedented situation in free fall. 
Biologically it has experienced the 
condition for very short periods — 
falling out of trees, or on delayed 
parachute jumps. But it isn’t consti- 
tuted to take hour after hour of 
fall.” 

"What about floating in a pool 
for hours?” asked Marcia sullenly. 

"That’s quite a different situa-' 
tion. ’Down’ exists when you’re 
swimming. Free-fall means that 
everything around you is ’up.’ The 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



body’s reactions to free-fall go 
much deeper than space-nausea and 
a mild feeling of panic. When 
there's a glandular imbalance of 
certain kinds, the results can be 
drastic. Apparently some instinc- 
tual part of the mind reacts as if 
there were a violent emergency, 
when no emergency is recognized 
by the reasoning part of the mind. 
There are sudden floods of adren- 
alin; the 17-kesteroids begin spas- 
tic secretions; the — well, it varies 
in individuals. But it’s pretty well 
established that the results can be 
fatal. It kills men with prostate 
trouble — sometimes. It kills women 
in menopause — often. It kills 
women in the early stages of preg- 
nancy — always.” 

"But how?" asked Marcia, in- 
terested in spite of her resentment. 

"Convulsions. A battle royal be- 
tween a glandular-level panic and a 
violent and useless effort of the 
will to control the situation. 
Muscles tear, working against one 
another. Lungs rupture and air is 
forced into the blood-stream, caus- 
ing embolism and death. Not 
everything is known about it, but 
I would guess that pregnant women 
are especially susceptible because 
their protective reflexes, through 
and through, are much more easily 
stimulated.” 

"And the only thing that can be 
done about it is to supply gravity?" 

"Or centrifugal force (or cen- 
tripetal, depending on where you’re 
standing, but why be technical?). — - 



or, better yet, keep those people off 
the ships." 

"So now Jack will spin the ship 
until I’m pressed against the walls 
with the same force as gravity, and 
then everything will be all right.” 
"You make it sound so simple.” 
"There’s no need to be sarcas- 
tic!” Marcia blurted. "Jack can do 
it. You think he can, don’t you? 
Don’t you?” 

"He can do anything any space 
skipper has ever done, and more,” 
said Sue Eagen, and her face 
glowed. "But it isn’t easy. Right 
this minute he’s working over the 
computer — a small, simple, ship- 
board computer — working out or- 
bital and positional and blast-in- 
tensity data that would be a hard 
nut for the giant calculators on 
Earth to crack. And he’s doing it 
in half the time — or less — than it 
would take the average mathemati- 
cian, because he has to; because it's 
a life-and-death matter if he makes 
a mistake or takes too long.” 

“OUT— but— ” 

U "But what?” Miss Eag- 
en’s composure seemed to have 
been blasted to shreds by the pow- 
erful currents of her indignation. 
Her eyes flashed. "You mean, but 
why doesn’t he just work the ship 
while it’s spinning the same way 
he does when it isn’t?” 

Through a growing fear, Marcia 
nodded mutely. 

"He’ll spin the ship on its long 
axis,” said the stewardess with ex- 



JAYWALKER 



59 



aggerated patience. "That means 
that the steering jet tubes in the 
nose and tail are spinning, too. 
You don’t just turn with a blast on 
one tube or another. The blasts 
have to be let off in hundreds of 
short bursts, timed to the hun- 
dredth of a second, to be able to 
make even a slight course correc- 
tion. The sighting instruments are 
wheeling round and round while 
you’re checking your position. Your 
fuel has to be calculated to the last 
ounce — because enough fuel for a 
Moon flight, with hours of fuelless 
free-fall, and enough fuel for a 
power spin and course corrections 
while spinning, are two very dif- 
ferent things. Captain McHenry 
won’t be able to maneuver to a 
landing on the Moon. He’ll do it 
exactly right the first time, or not 
at all.” 

Marcia was white and still. "I — 
I never — ” 

“But I haven’t told you the 
toughest part of it yet," Miss 
Eagen went on inexorably. "A ship 
as massive as this, spinning on its 
long axis, is a pretty fair gyroscope. 
It doesn’t want to turn. Any force 
that tries to make it turn is resisted 
at right angles to the force applied. 
When that force is applied momen- 
tarily from jets, as they swing into 
position and away again, the firing 
formulas get — well, complex. And 
the ship’s course and landing ap- 
proach are completely new. Instead 
of letting the ship fall to the Moon, 
turning over and approaching tail- 

60 



first with the main jets as brakes, 
Captain McHenry is going to have 
to start the spin first and go almost 
the whole way nose-first. He’ll 
come up on the Moon obliquely, 
pass it, stop the spin, turn over 
once to check the speed of the ship, 
and once again to put the tail down 
when the Moon’s gravity begins to 
draw us in. There’ll be two short 
periods of free-fall there, but they 
won’t be long enough to bother 
you much. And if we can do all 
that with the fuel we’ve got, it will 
be a miracle. A miracle from the 
brain of Captain McHenry.” 

Marcia forced herself away from 
the bulkhead with a small whimper 
of hurt and hatred — hatred of the 
stars, of this knowledgeable, in- 
spired girl, and — even more so — 
of' herself. She darted toward the 
door. 

Miss Eagen was beside her in an 
instant, a hard small hand on her 
arm. "Where are you going?” 
"I’m going to stop him. He can’t 
take that chance with his ship, with 
these people . .” 

"He will and he must. You sure- 
ly know your husband.” 

’'I know him as well as you do.” 

1SS EAGEN’S firm lips shut 
in a thin hard line. “Do as 
you like,” she whispered. "And 
while you’re doing it — think about 
whom he’s spinning ship for.” She 
took her hand from Marcia’s arm. 

Marcia twisted away and went 
into the corridor. 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



She found herself at the entrance 
to the pilot room. In one sweep- 
ing glance she saw a curved, silver 
board. Before it a man sat tran- 
quilly. Nearer to her was Jack, 
hunched over the keyboard of a 
complex, compact machine, like a 
harried bookkeeper on the last day 
of the month. 

Her lips formed his name, but 
she was silent. She watched him, 
his square, competent hands, his 
detached and distant face. Through 
the forward view-plate she saw a 
harsh, jagged line, the very edge 
of the Moon’s disc. Next to it, and 
below, was the rear viewer, hold- 
ing the shimmering azure shape of 
Earth. 

"All Earth watches me when I 
work, but with your eyes.” 

Jack had said that to her once, 
long ago, when he still loved her. 

. human damnfoolishness 
botching up the equations . He 
had said that once, too. 

Miss Eagen was standing by the 
hospital door, watching her. When 
Marcia turned away without speak- 
ing to Jack, Miss Eagen smiled and 
held out her hand. 

Marcia went to her and took the 
hand. They went into the hospital. 
Miss Eagen didn’t speak; she 

seemed to be waiting. 

"Yes, I know who Jack’s spin- 

ning ship for,” said Marcia. 

Miss Eagen looked an unspoken 
question. 

Marcia said, painfully, "He’s 
like the Captain of the Elsinore. 



He’s risking his life for a — a 
stranger. A jaywalker. Not for me. 
Not even for his baby.” 

"Does it hurt to know that?” 
Marcia looked into the smooth, 
strong face and said with genuine 
astonishment, "Hurt? Oh, no! 
It’s so — so big!” 

There was a sudden thunder. 
Over Miss Eagen’s shoulder, 
through the port, Marcia saw the 
stars begin to move. Miss Eagen 
followed her gaze. "He’s started 
the spin. You’ll be all right now.” 

M ARCIA could never recall the 
rest of the details of the trip. 
There was the outboard bulkhead 
that drew her like a magnet, in- 
creasingly, until suddenly it wasn’t 
an attracting wall, but normally 
and naturally "down.” Then a 
needle, and another one, and a 
long period of deep drowsiness and 
unreality. 

But through and through that 
drugged, relaxed period, Jack and 
the stars, the Moon and Sue Eagen 
danced and wove. Words slipped 
in and out of it like shreds of 
melody: 

"A man comes to love the things 
he has to fight for.” And Jack 
fighting — for his ship, for the 
Moon, for the new-building tradi- 
tions of the great ones who would 
carry humanity out to the stats. 

Sue Eagen was there, too, and 
the thing she shared with Jack, Of. 
course there was something be- 
tween them — so big a thing that 



JAYWALKER 



61 



there was nothing for her to fear 
in it. 

Jack and Sue Eagen had always 
had it, and always would have; and 
now Marcia had it too. And with 
understanding replacing fear, Mar 
cia was free to recall that Jack had 
worked with Sue Eagen — but it was 
Marcia that he had loved and 
married. 

T HERE was a long time of 
blackness, and then a time of 
agony, when she was falling, fall- 
ing, and her lungs wanted to split, 
explode, disintegrate, and someone 
kept saying, "Hold tight, Marcia; 
hold tight to me,” and she found 
Sue Eagen’s cool strong hands in 
hers. 

Marcia. She called me Marcia. 
More blackness, more pain — but 
not so much this time; and then a 
long, deep sleep. 

A curved ceiling, but a new 
curve, and soft rose instead of the 
gunmetal-and-chrome of the ship. 
White sheets, a new feeling of 
"down” that was unlike either 
Earth or the ship, a novel and ex- 
hilarating buoyancy. And kneeling 
by the bed — 

"Jack!” 

"You’re all right, honey.” 

She raised herself on her elbow 
and looked out through the un- 
glazed window at the ordered 
streets of the great Luna Dome. 
"The Moon . Jack, you did it!” 
He snapped his fingers. He look- 
ed like a high-school kid. "Nothin’ 

62 



to it.” She could see he was very 
proud. Very tired, too. He reached 
out to touch her. 

She drew back. You don’t have 
to be sweet to me,” she said quiet- 
ly ”1 understand how you must 
feel.” 

"Don’t have to?” He rose, bent 
over her, and slid his arms around 
her. He put his face into the 
shadowed warmth between her hair 
and her neck and said, "Listen, 
egghead, there’s no absolute scale 
for courage. We had a bad time, 
both of us. After it was over, and 
I had a chance to think, I used it 
trying to look at things through 
your eyes. And that way I found 
out that when you walked up that 
gangway, you did the bravest thing 
I’ve ever known anyone to do. And 
you did it for me. It doesn't mat- 
ter what else happened. Sue told 
me a lot about you that I didn’t 
know, darling. You’re . real 
huge for your size. As for the bad 
part of what happened — nothing 
like it can ever happen again, can 
it?” 

He hugged her. After a time 
he reached down and touched her 
swelling waist. It was like a bene- 
diction. "He’ll be born on the 
Moon,” he whispered, "and he’ll 
have eyes the color of all Earth 
when it looks out to the stars.” 

"She’ll be born on the Moon,” 
corrected Marcia, "and her name 
will be Sue, and . and she’ll be 
almost as good as her father.”

T HERE is a certain wry sig- 
nificance to a section of the 
New York Times’ list of 
best sellers in the October 8, 1950 
edition: Item 5 was "Dianetics;” 
item 6 was Overstreet’s "The Ma- 
ture Mind;” item 7 was Velikov- 
sky; and item 9 was Frank Scully’s 
Behind the Flying Saucers (Henry 
Holt & Co., 230 pp. $2.75). It 
may be wondered how Dr. Over- 
street likes the odd company he is 
forced to keep, for maturity is not 
the keynote here. 

Certainly he would have some 
pungent things to say about the 
Scully opus. Assertedly a non-fic- 



tion job, this book is actually 
stranger than truth. It is also one 
of the worst-edited books of the 
decade. In addition to endless repi- 
titions which any editor above the 
age of fifteen should have elimin- 
ated, it floats on an uneasy sea of 
typographical errors, the most 
charming of which occurs in a sen- 
tence on page 192 which begins: 
"Captain roads, 'Residents in al- 
most every section . .” which 
requires long and puzzled thought 
to translate to "Caption reads, 
"Residents . etc.” 

Teeing off with the inevitable 
attacks on conventional science and

military security that are the 
pseudo-scientists’ substitutes for 
scientific proof. Variety columnist 
Scully leads the fascinated reader 
through bubbling suppositious 
"fact" and "inference” about the 
origins, nature and purposes of 
the flying saucers. He puts on ex- 
hibit a supposed geodesics expert, 
"Dr. Gee,” who claims months of 
research on three flying discs 
which, he declares, the Air Force 
had found and sequestered. He de- 
scribes two types of metal from 
the discs which are totally unfa- 
miliar to Earth scientists; push- 
button control boards which the 
Air Force experts destroyed with- 
out attempting to analy 2 e; and 
3- to 4-foot human-seeming occu- 
pants (all dead) about whom the 
most remarkable things seem to 
have been their absolutely perfect 
teeth. 

T HE spice in Scully’s barbecue is 
an analysis of what he believes 
to be the saucers’ motive power, 
which turns out to be inter- 
planetary magnetism. This is the 
product of a new science which 
has learned how to cut the mag- 
netic lines of force holding the 
planets and the Sun in position and 
"thus” (says Scully) makes pos- 
sible travel in space at speeds as 
high as 282,000 miles per second 
— and the back of the Scully hand 
to Dr. Einstein. According to the 
author, the Department of Defense 
has already spent over a billion 

«4 



dollars investigating this same 
force. 

The book may be a compendium 
of scientific fact, superbly dis- 
guised as screwball gibberish. The 
disguise, in this case, is absolutely 
impenetrable. Whatever else it is, 
however, it is not dull! 

While Scully’s opus pretends to 
be true, Hugo Gernsback’s "Ralph 
124C 41+” (Frederick Fell, 207 
pp., $2.50), originally published 
in 1911, contains a goodly number 
of then-fantastic scientific ideas 
that have since become fact. It also 
is a lot of fun to read. I admit that 
I approached the book with some 
trepidation, fearing that the writ- 
ing and the concepts would be so 
amateur and so hoary with age that 
it would be unreadable. True 
enough, the plot is old-hat and the 
style is awkward — and even so 
"Ralph” is thoroughly delightful. 

It is more like the last of the 
Jules Verne novels than the first of 
the modern period of science fic- 
tion, and in that lies its greatest 
merit, I believe. It has the genuine 
charm of a sound, workmanlike 
antique, plus the often astonishing 
survival value of successful 
prophecy. You will not be disap- 
pointed with this tale. 

In the field of modern science 
fiction, Simon & Schuster has come 
out with a new Van Vogt. This one 
is called "The Voyage of the Space 
Beagle” (shades of Darwin!) 
(240 pp., $2.50). It is a skilful in- 
terweaving of three novelets, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Black Destroyer,” "Discord in 
Scarlet,” and a more recent item 
about birdlike people with in- 
credible powers of hypnosis. 

Holding the three together in a 
matrix of typically Van Vogtian 
metaphysical science is an inter- 
spersed narrative of the conflict be- 
tween Elliott Grosvenor, Nexialist, 
and the rest of the Beagle’s huge 
crew. Nexialism is a super-science 
which correlates and uses all other 
sciences, and Grosvenor naturally 
runs into opposition when he tries 
to use the other scientists on the 
ship for his own abstruse purposes. 
A magnificent exhibition of un- 
leashed imagination at work, and 
particularly pleasant because it is 
written in intelligent English. 

T HE same things can be said 
for another item on the 
month’s list — a seven-year-old book 
by a novelist and poet who is un- 
familiar to most science fiction ad- 
dicts. Its reissue in a pocket book 
gives me a chance to bring it to 
your attention. The book is Vin- 
cent McHugh’s delightful "I Am 
Thinking of My Darling” (Signet 
Books, 224 pp., 25tf). 

The story recounts what hap- 
pens in New York City when a 
new kind of epidemic breaks out 
— a low-grade fever which causes 
the loss of all inhibitions, all con- 
ventions, all hatreds. 

In the process of telling what 
happens when New York girls and 
New York men — and New York 



government agencies, too — "go nat- 
ural,” McHugh succeeds in giving 
us more sound and exciting micro- 
biology, biochemistry, epidemiology 
and information on municipal gov- 
ernment procedures than you could 
get in a year’s course in any stand- 
ard college. It’s also a rollicking, 
lusty, absolutely real and hand- 
somely written science fantasy. 

The only anthology to cross my 
desk this month is "The Best Sci- 
ence Fiction Stories — 1950” (Fred- 
erick Fell, 347 pp., $2.95.) This 
is Everett F. Bleiler’s and T. E. 
Dikty’s second in their annual 
series of selections from the pre- 
vious year’s short science fiction. 
Like the first one, it is generally a 
distinguished job. It contains 13 
stories (including two each by Ray 
Bradbury and the Leinster-Jenkins 
symbiosis) and of them all but 
four rate B-plus or better on my 
personal scale of merit. A high 
average, indeed! 

Our final item is the second in 
the science fiction series published 
by Greenberg, Publisher: "The 

Green Men of Graypec” by Festus 
Pragnell (185 pp., $2.50), a novel 
about which one can only say that 
it probably would have been better 
left in the quiet obscurity of the 
pulps where it first appeared. Fol- 
lowing as it does Ted Sturgeon’s 
fascinating "Dreaming Jewels” 
(see GALAXY for November 
1950), the comedown is all the 
• more painful.

and a Spear

BY RAYMOND F. JONES 



ROM Frederick to Balti- 
more, the rolling Maryland 
countryside lay under a 
fresh blanket of green. Wholly 
unaware of the summer glory, Dr. 
Curtis Johnson drove swiftly on 
the undulating highway, stirring 
clouds of dust and dried grasses. 

Beside him, his wife, Louise, 
held her blowing hair away from 
her face and laughed into the 
warm air. "Dr. Dell isn't going 
to run away. Besides, you said we 
could call this a weekend vacation 
as well as a business trip.” 

Curt glanced at the speedometer 
and eased the pressure on the 
pedal. He grinned. "Wool-gather- 
ing again.” 

"What about?” 

"I was just wondering who said 
it first — one of the fellows at Det- 
rick, or that lieutenant at Bikini, 
or — ”

"Said what ? What are you talk- 
ing about?” 

"That crack about the weapons 
after the next war. He — whoever 
it was — said there may be some 
doubt about what the weapons of 
the next war will be like, but 
there is absolutely no doubt about 
the weapons of World War IV. 
It will be fought with stones and 
spears. I guess any one of us 
could have said it.” 

Louise's smile grew tight and 
thin. "Don't any of you ever think 
of anything but the next war — 
any of you?” 

"How can we? We’re fighting 
it right now.” 

"You make it sound so hope- 
less.” 

"That’s what Dell said in the 
days just before he quit. He said 
we didn’t have to stay at Detrick 
producing the toxins and aerosols 
that will destroy millions of lives. 
But he never showed us how we 
could quit — and be sure of stay- 
ing alive. His own walking out 
was no more than a futile ges- 
ture.” 

"I just can’t understand him, 
Curt. I think he’s right in a way, 
but what brought him to that view- 
point?” 

"Hard to tell,” Curt said, un- 
consciously speeding up again. 
"After the war, when the atomic 
scientists were publicly examining 
their consciences, Dell told them 
to examine their own guts first. 
That was typical of him then, but 



soon after, he swung just as 
strongly pacifist and walked out 
of Detrick.” 

"It still seems strange that he 
abandoned his whole career. The 
world’s foremost biochemist giv- 
ing up the laboratory for a truck 
farm. 1 ’’ Louise glanced down at 
the lunch basket between them. 
In it were tomatoes that Dr. 
Hamon Dell had sent along with 
his invitation to visit him. 

F OR nearly a year Dr. Dell had 
been sending packages of 
choice fruit and vegetables to his 
former colleagues, not only at the 
biological warfare center at Camp 
Detrick but at the universities and 
other research centers throughout 
the country. 

”1 wish we knew exactly why 
he asked us to come out,” said 
Louise. 

"Nobody claims to have figured 
him out. They laugh a little at 
him now. They eat his gifts will- 
ingly enough, but consider him 
slightly off his rocker. He still has 
all his biological talents, though. 
I’ve never seen or tasted vegetables 
like the ones he grows.” 

"And the brass at Detrick 
doesn’t think he’s gone soft in 
the head, either,” she added much 
too innocently. "So they ordered 
you to take advantage of his invi- 
tation and try to persuade him to 
come back.” 

Curt turned his head so sharp- 
ly that Louise laughed.

"No, I didn’t read any secret, 
hush-hush papers,” she said. "But 
it’s pretty obvious, isn’t it, the way 
you rushed right over to General 
Hansen after you got the invita- 
tion?” 

"It is hush-hush, top-secret 
stuff,” said Curt, his eyes once 
more on the road. "The Army 
doesn’t want it to leak, but they 
need Dell, need him badly. Any- 
one knowing bio-war develop- 
ments would understand. They 
wanted to send me before. Dell’s 
invitation was the break we need- 
ed. I may be the one with sufficient 
influence to bring him back. I 
hope so. But - keep it under your 
permanent and forget your guess- 
ing games. There’s more to it 
than you know.” 

The car passed through a cool, 
wooded section and Louise leaned 
back and drank in the beauty of it. 

"Hush-hush, top secret stuff,” 
she said. "Grown men playing 
children’s games.” 

"Pretty deadly games for chil- 
dren, darling.” 

I N THE late afternoon they by- 
passed the central part of Bal- 
timore and headed north beyond 
the suburb of Towson toward 
Dell’s truck farm. 

His sign was visible for a half 
mile: 

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT 
Eat the Best 

EAT DELL’S VEGETABLES 



"Dr. Hamon Dell, world’s 

foremost biochemist — and truck 
farmer,” Curt muttered as he 

swung the car off the highway. 

Louise stepped out when the 
tires ceased crunching on the 
gravel lane. She scanned the fields 
and old woods beyond the an- 

cient but preserved farmhouse. 
"It’s so unearthly.” 

Curt followed. The song of 

birds, which had been so notice- 
able before, seemed strangely 
muted. The land itself was an 
alien, faintly greenish hue, a color 
repulsive to more than just the 
eyes. 

"It must be something in this 
particular soil,” said Curt, "some- 
thing that gives it that color and 
produces such wonderful crops. 
I’ll have to remember to ask Dell 
about it.” 

"You want Dr. Dell?” 

They whirled at the sound of 
an unfamiliar voice. Louise ut 
tered a startled cry. 

The gaunt figure behind them 
coughed asthmatically and point- 
ed with an arm that seemed com- 
posed only of bones and brownish 
skin, so thin as to be almost trans- 
lucent. 

"Yes," said Curt shakenly. 
"We’re friends of his.” 

"Dell’s in back. I’ll tell him 
you’re here.” 

The figure shambled away and 
Louise shook herself as if to rid 
her mind of the vision. "If our 
grandchildren ever ask about zom- 



A STONE AND A SPEAR

bies, I can tell them. Who in the 
world do you suppose he is?” 

"Hired man, I suppose. Sounds 
as if he should be in a lung sana- 
tarium. Funny that Dell would 
keep him around in that condi- 
tion.” 

From somewhere behind the 
house came the sound of a truck 
engine. Curt took Louise's arm and 
led her around the trim, graveled 
path. 

The old farmhouse had been 
very carefully renovated. Every- 
where was evidence of exqusite 
care, yet the cumulative atmosphere 
remained uninviting, almost op- 
pressive. Curt told himself it was 
the utter silence, made even more 
tense by the lonely chugging of 
the engine in back, and the in- 
credible harsh color of the soil 
beneath their feet. 

R OUNDING the corner, they 
came in sight of a massive 
tank truck. From it a hose led to 
an underground storage tank and 
pulsed slowly under the force of 
the liquid gushing through it. No 
one was in sight. 

"What could that be for?” 
asked Louise. 

"You've got me. Could be gaso- 
line, but Dell hasn't any reason 
for storing that much here.” 
They advanced slowly and 
amazement crept over Curt as he 
comprehended the massiveness of 
the machine. The tank was of 
elliptical cross section, over ten 



feet on its major axis. Six double 
wheels supported the rear; even 
the front ones were double. In 
spite of such wide weight distri- 
bution, the tires were pressing 
down the utterly dry ground to 
a depth of an inch or more. 

"They must haul liquid lead in 
that thing,” said Curt. 

"It’s getting cool. I wish Dell 
would show up.” Louise glanced 
out over the twenty-acre expanse 
of truck farm. Thick rows of ro- 
bust plants covered the area. To- 
matoes, carrots, beets, lettuce, and 
other vegetables — a hundred or so 
fruit trees were at the far end. 
Between them ran the road over 
which the massive truck had ap- 
parently entered the farm from the 
rear. 

A heavy step sounded abruptly 
and Dell’s shaggy head appeared 
from around the end of the truck. 
His face lighted with pleasure. 

"Curt, my boy! And Louise! I 
thought you weren’t going to show 
up at all.” 

Curt’s hand was almost lost in 
Dell's enormous grip, but it 
wasn’t because of that that his 
grip was passive. It was his 
shocked reaction to Dell’s haggard 
appearance. The fierce eyes looked 
merely old and tired now. The 
ageless, leathery hide of Dell's 
face seemed to have collapsed be- 
fore some overpowering decay, its 
bronze smoothness shattered by 
deep lines that were like tool 
marks of pain.

Curt spoke in a subdued voice. 
"It’s hard to get away from Det- 
rick. Always one more experiment 
to try — ” 

" — And the brass riding you 
as if they expected you to win an- 
other war for them tomorrow aft- 
ernoon,” said Dell. "I remember.” 
"We wondered about this 
truck,” Louise commented bright- 
ly, trying to change the subject. 
"We finally gave up on it.” 

"Oh, that. It brings liquid fer- 
tilizer to pump into my irrigation 
water, that's all. No mystery. Let’s 
go on to the house. After you’re 
settled we can catch up on every- 
thing and I’ll tell you about the 
things I’m doing here.” 

"Who’s the man we saw?” 
asked Curt. "He looks as if his 
health is pretty precarious.” 

"That’s Brown. He came with 
the place — farmed it for years for 
my uncle before I inherited it. He 
could grow a garden on a granite 
slab. In spite of appearances, he’s 
well enough physically.” 

"How has your own health 
been? You have — changed — since 
you were at Detrick.” 

Dell raised a lock of steel-gray 
hair in his fingers and dismissed 
the question with a wan smile. 
"We all wear out sometime,” he 
said. "My turn had to come.” 

I NSIDE, some of the oppres- 
siveness vanished as the eve- 
ning passed. It was cool enough 
for lighting the fireplace, and they 



settled before it after dinner. 
While they watched the Bickering 
light that whipped the beamed 
ceiling, Dell entertained them with 
stories of his neighbors, whose 
histories he knew clear back to 
Revolutionary times. 

Early, however, Louise excused 
herself. She knew they would 
want privacy to thresh out the pur- 
poses behind Dell’s invitation — 
and Curt’s acceptance. 

When she was gone, there was 
a moment’s silence. The logs 
crackled with shocking pistol shots 
in the fireplace. The scientist 
moved to stir the coals and then 
turned abruptly to Curt. 

"When are you going to leave 
Detrick?” 

"When are you coming back?” 
Curt demanded instead of answer- 
ing. 

' "So they still want me, even 
after the things I said when I 
left.” 

"You're needed badly. When I 
told Hansen I was coming down, 
he said it would be worth five 
years of my own work to bring 
you back.” 

"They want me to produce even 
deadlier toxins than those I gave 
them,” Dell said viciously. "They 
want some that can kill ten mil- 
lion people in four minutes in- 
stead of only one million — ” 

"Any man would go insane if 
he looked at it that way. It would 
be the same as gun-makers being 
tormented by the vision of torn 



A STONE AND A SPEAR 



71 



men destroyed by their bullets, the 
sorrowing families — ” 

“And why shouldn’t the gun- 
makers be tormented?” Dell's 
voice was low with controlled 
hate. "They are men like you and 
me who give the war - makers new 
tools for their trade.” 

"Oh, Dell, it’s not as simple as 
that.” Curt raised a hand and let 
it fall wearily. They had been over 
this so many times before. 
“Weapon designers are no more 
responsible than any other agents 
of society. It’s pure neurosis to 
absorb the whole guilt of wars yet 
unfought merely because you hap- 
pened to have developed a poten- 
tial weapon.” 

Dell touched the massive dome 
of his skull. “Here within this 
brain of mine has been conceived 
a thing which will probably de- 
stroy a billion human lives in the 
coming years. D. triconus toxin in 
a suitable aerosol requires only a 
countable number of molecules in 
the lungs of a man to kill him. 
My brain and mine alone is re- 
sponsible for that vicious, murder- 
ous discovery.” 

“Egotism! Any scientist’s work 
is built upon the pyramid of past 
knowledge.” 

«mH£ weapon I have described 

-L exists. If I had not created 
it, it would not exist. It is as 
simple as that. No one shares my 
guilt and my responsibility. And 
what more do they want of me 

72 



now? What greater dream of mass 
slaughter and destruction have they 
dreamed ?” 

“They want you,” said Curt 
quietly, "because they believe we 
are not the only ones possessing' 
the toxin. They need you to come 
back and help find the antitoxin 
for D. triconus.” 

Dell shook his head. “That’s a 
blind hope. The action of D. tri- 
conus is like a match set to a 
powder train. The instant its 
molecules contact protoplasm, they 
start a chain reaction that rips 
apart the cell structure. It spreads 
like fire from one cell to the next, 
and nothing can stop it once it’s 
started operating within a given 
organism.” 

“But doesn’t this sense of guilt 
— unwarranted as it is — make you 
want to find an antitoxin?” 

“Suppose I succeeded? I would 
have canceled the weapon of an 
enemy. The military would know 
he could nullify ours in time. 
Then they would command me to 
work out still another toxin. It’s 
a vicious and insane circle, which 
must be broken somewhere. The 
purpose of the entire remainder 
of my life is to break it.” 

“When you are fighting for 
your life and the enemy already 
has his hands about your throat,” 
Curt argued, “you reach for the 
biggest rock you can get your 
hands on and beat his brains in. 
You don’t try to persuade him 
that killing is unethical.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



For an instant it seemed to Curt 
that a flicker of humor touched 
the corners of Dell’s mouth. Then 
the lines tightened down again. 

"Exactly,” he said. "You reach 
for a rock and beat his brains in. 
You don’t wipe human life off 
the face of the Earth in order to 
reach that enemy. I asked you to 
come down here to help me break 
this circle of which I spoke. There 
has to be someone here — after I’m 
gone — ” 

Dell’s eyes shifted to the depths 
of shadows beyond the firelight 
and remained fixed on unseen 
images. 

"Me? Help you?” Curt asked 
incredulously. "What could I do? 
Give up science and become a 
truck gardener, too?” 

"You might say that we would 
be in the rock business,” replied 
Dell. “Fighting is no longer on 
the level of one man with his 
hands .-about another’s throat, but 
it should be. Those who want 
power and domination should 
have to fight for it personally. But 
it has been a long time since they 
had to. 

<<T7WEN in the old days, kings 
and emperors, hired mer- 
cenaries to fight their wars. The 
militarists don’t buy swords now. 
They buy brains. We’re the mer- 
cenaries of the new day, Cart, you 
and I. Once there was honor in 
our profession. We searched for 
truth for its own sake, and be- 



cause it was our way of life. Once 
we were the hope of the world 
because science was a universal 
language. 

"What a horrible joke that 
turned out to be! Today we are 
the terror of the world. The war- 
makers built us fine laboratories, 
shining palaces, and granted every 
whim — for a price. They took us 
up to the hills and showed us the 
whole world and we sold our souls 
for it. 

"Look what happened after the 
last war. Invading armies carried 
off prize Nazi brains like so much 
loot, set the scientists up in big 
new laboratories, and these new 
mercenaries keep right on pour- 
ing out knowledge for other kings 
and emperors. 

"Their loyalty is only to their 
science. But they can’t experiment 
for knowledge any more, only 
weapons and counter-weapons. 
You'll say I’m anti-war, even, per- 
haps, anti-American or pro-Rus- 
sian. I am not against just wars, 
but I am against unjust slaughter. 
And I love America too much to 
let her destroy herself along with 
the enemy.” 

"Then what are we to do?” Curt 
demanded fiercely. "What are we 
to do while enemy scientists pre- 
pare these same weapons to ex- 
terminate us? Sure, it’s one hell 
of a mess. Science is already dead. 
The kind you talk about has been 
dead for twenty years. All our fine 
ideals are worthless until the poli-

73 



ticians find a solution to their 
quarrels.” 

"Politicians? Since when did 
men of science have to wait upon 
politicians for solutions of human 
problems?” Dell passed a hand 
over his brow, and suddenly his 
face contorted in pain. 

"What is it?” Curt exclaimed, 
rising. 

"Nothing — nothing, my boy. 
Some minor trouble I’ve had late- 
ly.- It will pass in a moment.” 

With effort, he went on. "I 
wanted to say that already you 
have come to think of science be- 
ing divided into armed camps by 
the artificial boundaries of the 
politicians. Has it been so long 
ago that it was not even in your 
lifetime, when scientists regarded 
themselves as one international 
brotherhood ?” 

"I can’t quarrel with your 
ideals,” said Curt softly. "But na- 
tional boundary lines do, actually, 
divide the scientists of the world 
into armed camps.” 

<< "\7’OUR premises are still in- 

JL correct. They do not de- 
liberately war on each other. It is 
only that they have blindly sold 
themselves as mercenaries. And 
they can be called upon to redeem 
themselves. They can break their 
unholy contracts.” 

"There would have to be simul- 
taneous agreement among the 
scientists of all nations. And they 
are men, influenced by national 



ideals. They are not merely 
ivory-tower dabblers and searchers 
after truth.” 

"Do you remember me five 
years ago?" Dell’s face became 
more haggard, as if the memory 
shamed him. "Do you remember 
when I told the atomic scientists 
to examine their guts instead of 
their consciences?” 

"Yes. You certainly have 
changed.” 

"And so can other men. There 
is a way. I need your help desper- 
ately, Curt — ” 

The face of the aging biochem- 
ist contorted again with unbear- 
able pain. His forehead beaded 
with sweat as he clenched his 
skull between his vein-knotted 
hands. 

"Dell! What is it?” 

"It will pass,” Dr. Dell breathed 
through clenched teeth. "I have 
some medicine — in my bedroom. 
I’m afraid I’ll have to excuse my- 
self tonight. There’s so much more 
I have to say to you, but we’ll 
continue our talk in the morning, 
Curt. I’m sorry — ” 

He stumbled out, refusing 
Curt’s offer of aid with a grim 
headshake. The fire crackled loud- 
ly within the otherwise silent 
room. Curt felt cold at the de- 
scending chill of the night, his 
mind bewildered at Dell’s barrage, 
some of it so reasonable, some of 
it so utterly confused. And there 
was no clue to the identity of the 
powerful force that had made so 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



great a change in the once militant 
scientist. 

Slowly Curt mounted the stair- 
case of the old house and went 
to the room Dell had assigned 
them. Louise was in bed reading 
a murder mystery. 

"Secret mission completed?” she 
asked. 

Curt sat down on the edge of 
the bed. "I’m afraid something 
terrible is wrong with Dell. Be- 
sides the neurotic guilt complex 
because of his war work, he 
showed signs of a terrific and ap- 
parently habitual pain in his head. 
If that should be brain tumor, it 
might explain his erratic notions, 
his abandonment of his career.” 

"Oh, I hope it’s not that!” 

T SEEMED to Curt that he had 
slept only minutes before he 
was roused by sounds in the night. 
He rolled over and switched on 
the light. His watch said two 
o'clock. Louise raised up in sharp 
alarm. 

"What is it?” she whispered. 

"I thought I heard something. 
There it is again!” 

■'It sounds like someone in 
pain. It must be Dell!” 

Curt leaped from the bed and 
wrestled into his bathrobe. As he 
hurried toward Dell’s room, there 
was another deep groan that end- 
ed in a shuddering sob of unbear- 
able agony. 

He burst into the scientist’s 
room and switched on the light. 



Dell looked up, eyes glazed with 
pain. 

"Dr. Dell!” 

"Curt — I thought I had time 
left, but this is as far as I can go — 
Just remember all I said tonight. 
Don’t forget a word of it.” He sat 
up rigidly, hardly breathing in the 
effort of control. "The responsi- 
bility for the coming destruction 
of civilization lies at the doors of 
the scientist mercenaries. Don’t 
allow it, Curt. Get them to aban- 
don the laboratories of the war- 
riors. Get them to reclaim their 
honor — ” 

He fell back upon the pillow, 
his face white with pain and shin- 
ing with sweat. "Brown — see 

Brown. He can tell you the — the 
rest.” 

"I’ll go for a doctor,” said Curt. 
"Who have you had? Louise will 
stay with you.” 

"Don’t bring a doctor. There’s 
no escaping this. I’ve known it 
for months. Wait here with me, 
Curt. I’ll be gone soon.” 

Curt stared with pity at the great 
scientist whose mind had so dis- 
integrated. "You need a doctor. 
I’ll call a hospital, Johns Hopkins, 
if you want.” 

"Wait, maybe you’re right. I 
have no phone here. Get Dr. Wil- 
son — the Judge Building, Towson 
• — find his home address in a phone 
book.” 

"Fine. I’ll only be a little 
while.” 

He stepped to the door. 



A STONE AND A SPEAR

"Curt! Take the lane down to 
the new road — behind the farm. 
Quicker — it cuts off a mile or so 
— go down through the or- 
chard — ” 

"All right. Take it easy now. 
I’ll be right back.” 

Curt frantically got dressed, ran 
down the stairs and out to the 
car. He wondered absently what 
had become of the cadaverous 
Brown, who seemed to have van- 
ished from the premises. 

T HE wheels spun gravel as he 
started the car and whipped 
it out of the driveway. Then he 
was on the stretch of lane leading 
through the grove. The moonless 
night was utterly dark, and the 
stream of light ahead of the car 
seemed the only living thing upon 
the whole landscape. He almost 
wished he had taken the more 
familiar road. To get lost now 
might mean death for Dell. 

No traffic flowed past him in 
either direction. There were no 
buildings showing lights. Over- 
whelming desolation seemed to 
possess the countryside and seep 
into his soul. It seemed impossible 
that this lay close to the other 
highway with which he was 
familiar. 

He strained his eyes into the 
darkness for signs of an all-night 
gas station or store from which 
he could phone. Finally, he re- 
signed himself to going all the 
way to Towson. At that moment 



lie glimpsed a spark of light far 
ahead. 

Encouraged, Curt stepped on 
the gas. In less than ten minutes 
he was at the spot. He braked 
the car to a stop, and surveyed the 
building as he got out. It seemed 
more like a power substation than 
anything else. But there should 
be a telephone, at least. 

He knocked on the door. Al- 
most instantly, footsteps sounded 
within. 

The door swung wide. 

“I wonder if I could use 
your — ’’ Curt began. He gasped. 
"Brown! Dell’s dying — we’ve got 
to get a doctor for him — ” 

As if unable to comprehend, 
the hired man stared dumbly for 
a long moment. His hollow- 
cheeked face was almost skeletal 
in the light that flooded out from 
behind him. 

Then from somewhere within 
the building came a voice, sharp 
with tension. "Brown! What the 
devil are you doing? Shut that 
door!” 

That brought the figure to life. 
He whipped out a gun and mo- 
tioned Curt inward. "Step inside. 
We’ll have to decide what to do 
with you when Carlson finds 
you’re here.” 

"What’s the matter with you?” 
Curt asked, stupefied. "Dell’s dy- 
ing. He needs help.” 

"Get in here!” 

Curt moved slowly forward. 
Brown closed the door behind him 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and motioned toward a closed 
door at the other end of a short 
hall. They opened it and stepped 
into a dimly lighted room. 

Curt’s eyes slowly adjusted and 
he saw what seemed to be a lab- 
oratory. It was so packed with 
equipment that there was scarcely 
room for the group of twelve or 
fifteen men jammed closely about 
some object with their backs to 
Curt and Brown. 

Brown shambled forward like 
an agitated skeleton, breaking the 
circle. Then Curt saw that the ob- 
ject of the men's attention was a 
large cathode ray screen occupied 
by a single green line. There was 
a pip on it rising sharply near one 
side of the two-foot tube. The pip 
moved almost imperceptibly to- 
ward a vertical red marker over 
the face of the screen. The men 
stared as if hypnotized by it. 

T HE newcomers’ arrival, how- 
ever, disturbed their atten- 
tion. One man turned with an 
irritable growl. "Brown, for 
heaven’s sake — ” 

He was a bony creature, even 
more cadaverous than Brown. He 
caught sight of Curt’s almost in- 
decently robust face. He gasped 
and swore. 

"Who is this? What’s he do- 
ing here?” 

The entire montage of skull 
faces turned upon Curt. He heard 
a sharp collective intake of breath, 
as if his presence were some un- 



foreseen calamity that had shaken 
the course of their incomprehen- 
sible lives. 

"This is Curtis Johnson,” said 
Brown. “He got lost looking for 
a doctor for Dell.” 

A mummylike figure rose from 
a seat before the instrument. 
"Your coming is tremendously un- 
fortunate, but for the moment we 
can do nothing about it. Sit here 
beside me. My name is Tarron 
Sark.” 

The man indicated a chair. 

"My friend. Dr. Dell, is dy- 
ing,” Curt snapped out, refusing 
to sit down. 'T’ve got to get help. 
I saw your light and hoped you’d 
allow me to use your phone. I 
don’t know who you are nor what 
Dell’s hired man is doing here 
with you. But you’ve got to let 
me go for help!” 

"No.” The man, Sark, shook 
his head. "Dell is reconciled. He 
has to go. We are awaiting pre- 
cisely the event you would halt — - 
his death.” 

He had known it. Curt thought, 
from the moment he entered that 
room. Like vultures sitting on 
cliffs waiting for the death of their 
prey, these fantastic men let their 
glance slip back to the screen. The 
green line was a third of the way 
toward the red marker now, and 
moving more rapidly. 

It was nightmare — meaning- 

less — 

’'I’m not staying," Curt insisted. 
"You can’t prevent me from help-

ing Dell without assuming respon- 
sibility for his death. I demand 
you let me call.” 

"You’re not going to call,” said 
Sark wearily. "And we assumed 
responsibility for Dell’s death long 
ago. Sit down!” 

Slowly Curt sank down upon 
the chair beside the stranger. 
There was nothing else to do. He 
was powerless against Brown’s 
gun. But he’d bring them to jus- 
tice somehow, he swore. 

He didn’t understand the mean- 
ing of the slowly moving pattern 
on the ’scope face, yet, as his eyes 
followed that pip, he sensed ten- 
sion in the watching men that 
seemed sinister, almost murderous. 
How? 

What did the inexorably advanc- 
ing pip signify? 

N O ONE spoke. The room was 
stifling hot and the breathing 
of the circle of men was a dull, 
rattling sound in Curt’s ears. 

Quickly then, gathering sudden 
momentum, the pip accelerated. 
The circle of men grew taut. 

The pip crossed the red line — 
and vanished. 

Only the smooth green trace re- 
mained, motionless and without 
meaning. 

With hesitant shuffling of feet, 
the circle expanded. The men 
glanced uncertainly at one an- 
other. 

One said, "Well, that’s the end 
of Dell. We’ll soon know now 



if we’re on the right track, or if 
we’ve botched it. Carlson will call 
when he’s computed it.” 

"The end of Dell?" Curt re- 
peated slowly, as if trying to con- 
vince himself of what he knew 
had happened. "The pip on the 
screen — that showed his life leav- 
ing him?” 

"Yes,” said Sark. "He knew he 
had to go. And there are perhaps 
hundreds more like him. But Dell 
couldn't have told you of that — ” 

"What will we do with him?” 
Brown asked abruptly. 

"If Dell is dead, you murdered 
him!” Curt shouted. 

A rising personal fear grew 
within him. They could not re- 
lease him now, even though his 
story would make no sense to any- 
body. But they had somehow killed 
Dell, or thought they had, and they 
wouldn’t hesitate to kill Curt. He 
thought of Louise in the great 
house with the corpse of Haman 
Dell — if, of course, he was ac- 
tually dead. But that was non- 
sense. 

"Dell must have sent you to 
us!” Sark said, as if a great mys- 
tery had suddenly been lifted from 
his mind. "He did not have time 
to tell you everything. Did he tell 
you to take the road behind the 
farm?” 

Curt nodded bitterly. "He told 
me it was the quickest way to get 
to a doctor.” 

"He did? Then he knew even 
better than we did how rapidly he 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was slipping. Yes, this was die 
quickest way.” 

"What are you talking about?” 
Curt demanded. 

"Did Dell say anything at all 
about what he wanted of you?” 

"It was all wild. Something 
about helping with some crazy 
plans to retreat from the scientific 
world. He was going to finish talk- 
ing in the morning, but I guess it 
wouldn't have mattered. I realize 
now that he was sick and irra- 
tional.” 

"Too sick to explain everything, 
but not irrational,” Sark said 
thoughtfully. "He left it to us to 
tell you, since you are to succeed 
him.” 

"Succeed Dell? In what?” 

S ARK suddenly flipped a switch 
on a panel at his right. A 
screen lighted with some fuzzy 
image. It cleared with a slight dial 
adjustment, and Curt seemed to 
be looking at some oddly familiar 
moonlit ruin. 

"An American city,” said Sark, 
hurrying his words now. "Any 
city. They are all alike. Ruin. 
Death. This one died thirty years 
ago.” 

"I don't understand,” Curt com- 
plained, bewildered. "Thirty 
years — 

"At another point in the Time 
Continuum,” said Sark. "The fu- 
ture. Your future, you understand. 
Or, rather, our present, the one 
you created for us.” 



Curt recoiled at the sudden 
venom in Sark’s voice. "The fu- 
ture?” That was what they had 
in common with Dell — psychosis, 
systematic delusions. He had sus- 
pected danger before; now it was 
imminent and terrifying. 

"Perhaps you are one of those 
who regard your accomplishments 
with pride,” Sark went on savage- 
ly, ignoring or unaware of Curt's 
fear and horror. "That the hydro- 
gen bombs smashed the cities, and 
the aerosols destroyed the rem- 
nants of humanity seems insignifi- 
cant to you beside the high 
technical achievement these things 
represent.” 

Curt’s throat was dry with panic. 
Irrelevantly, he recalled the pain- 
fired eyes of Dell and the dying 
scientist’s words: "The responsi- 
bility for the coming destruction 
of civilization lies at the doors of 
the scientist mercenaries — ” 

"Some of us did manage to sur- 
vive,” said Sark, glaring at the 
scene of gaunt rubble. Curt could 
see the veins pounding beneath 
the thin flesh of his forehead. "We 
lived for twenty years with the 
dream of rebuilding a world, the 
same dream that has followed all 
wars. But at last we knew that the 
dream was truly vain this time. 
We survivors lived in heremetically 
sealed caverns, trying to exist and 
recover our lost science and tech- 
nology. 

"We could not emerge into the 
Earth’s atmosphere. Its pollution 



A STONE AND A SPEAR 



79 



with virulent aerosols would per- 
sist for another hundred years. We 
could not bear a new race out of 
these famished and rickety bodies 
of ours. Unless Man was to van- 
ish completely from the face of 
the Earth, we had only a single 
hope. That hope was to prevent 
the destruction from ever occur- 
ring!” 

Sark’s eyes were burning now. 
"Do you understand what that 
means? We had to go back, not 
forward. We had to arm to fight 
a new war, a war to prevent the 
final war that destroyed Mankind.” 

"Back? How could you go 
back?" Curt hesitated, grasping 
now the full insanity of the scene 
about him. "How have you come 
back?” He waited tautly for the 
answer. It would be gibberish, of 
course, like all the mad conversa- 
tion before it. 

«rpHE undisturbed flow of time 

X from the beginning to the 
end — neither of which we can ex- 
perience — we call, the Prime Con- 
tinuum,” Sark replied. "Mathe- 
matically speaking, it is composed 
of billions of separate bands of 
probability running side by side. 
For analogy, you may liken it to a 
great river, whose many insignifi- 
cant tributaries merge into a roar- 
ing, turbulent whole. That is 
the flow of time, the Prime Con- 
tinuum. 

"You may change one of these 
tributaries, dam it up, turn it aside. 



let it reach the main stream at a 
different point. No matter how 
insignificant the tributary, the 
stream will not be the same after 
the change. That is what we are 
doing. We are controlling critical 
tributaries of the Prime Con- 
tinuum, altering the hell that you 
scientists have so generously hand- 
ed down to us. 

"Dell was a critical tributary. 
You, Dr. Curtis Johnson, are an- 
other. Changing or destroying such 
key individuals snips off branches 
of knowledge before they come 
into fruit." 

It was an ungraspable answer, 
but it had to be argued against 
because of its conclusion. "The 
scientists are not bringing about the 
war,” Curt said, looking from one 
fleshless face to another. "Find the 
politicians responsible, those will- 
ing to turn loose any horror to 
gain power. They are the ones you 
want.” 

"That would mean destroying 
half the human race. In your day, 
nearly every man is literally a poli- 
tician.” 

"Talk sense!” Curt said angrily. 

"A politician, as we have come 
to define him, is simply one will- 
ing to sacrifice the common good 
for his own ends. It is a highly 
infectious disease in a day when 
altruism is taken for cowardice or 
mere stupidity. No, we have not 
mistaken our goal, Dr. Johnson. 
We cannot hasten the maturity of 
the race. We can only hope to take

the matches away so the children 
cannot burn the house down. 
Whatever you doubt, do not doubt 
that we are from the future or 
that we caused Dell's death. He is 
only one of many.” 

Curt slumped. "I did doubt it. 
I still do, yet not with conviction. 
Why?" 

"Because your own sense of 
guilt tells you that you and Dell 
and others like you are literally 
the matches which we have to re- 
move. Because your knowledge of 
science has overcome your desire 
not to believe. Because you know 
the shape of the future.” 

"The war after the Third World 
War — ” Curt murmured. "Some- 
one said it would be fought with 
stones and spears, but your weap- 
ons are far from stones and 
spears.” 

"Perhaps not so far at that,” 
said Sark, his face twisting wryly. 
He reached to a nearby table and 
picked up a tomato and a carrot. 
"These are our weapons. As hum- 
ble and primitive as the stones and 
spears of cavemen.” 

<<'V7'OU'RE joking,” Curt re- 
JL plied, almost ready to grin. 
"No. This is the ultimate 
development of biological war- 
fare. Man is what he eats — ” 
"That’s what Dell’s sign said." 
"We operate hundreds of gar- 
dens and farms such as Dell’s. We 
work through the fertilizing com- 
pounds we supply to these farms. 



These compounds contain chem. 
icals that eventually lodge in the 
cells of those who eat the pro- 
duce. They take up stations within 
the brain cells and change the man 
— or destroy him. 

"Certain cells of the brain are re- 
sponsible for specific characteristics. 
Ways of altering these cells were 
found by introducing minute quan- 
tities of specific radioactive materi- 
als which could be incorporated into 
vegetable foods. During the Third 
War wholesale insanity was pro- 
duced in entire populations by 
similar methods. Here, we are 
using it to accomplish humane 
purposes. 

"We are simply restraining the 
scientists responsible for the de- 
stroying weapons that produced 
our nightmare world. You saw 
the change that took place in Dell. 
There is a good example of what 
we do.” 

"But he did change,” Curt 
pointed out. "He was carrying out 
your work. Wasn’t that enough 
for you? Why did you decide he 
had to die?” 

"Ordinarily, we don’t want to 
kill if the change is produced. 
Sometimes the brain cells are re- 
fractory and the characteristics too 
ingrained. The cells develop tum- 
orous activity as a result of the 
treatment. So it was with Dell. In 
his case, however, we would have 
been forced to kill him by other 
means if he had not died as he 
did. This, too, he understood very

well. That was why he really 
wanted no doctor to help him.” 

"You must have driven him in- 
sane first!” 

"Look at this and see if you 
still think so.” Sark led the way 
to a small instrument and pointed 
to the eyepiece of it. "Look in 
there.” 

Curt bent over. Light sprang up 
at Sark's touch of a switch. Then 
a scene began to move before 
Curt’s eyes. 

"Dell!” he exclaimed. 

The scene was of some vast and 
well-equipped biological labora- 
tory, much like those of Camp Det- 
rick. Silent, mask-faced technicians 
moved with precision about their 
tasks. Dr. Dell was directing opera- 
tions. 

But there was something wrong. 
The figure was not the Dell that 
Curt knew. 

As if Sark sensed Curt’s com- 
prehension of this, the scene ad- 
vanced and swelled until the 
whole area of vision was filled 
with Dell’s face. Curt gasped. The 
face was blank and hideous. The 
eyes stared. When the scene re- 
treated once more. Curt saw now 
that Dell moved as an automaton, 
almost without volition of his own. 

A S HE moved away from the 
bench like a sleepwalker, 
there came briefly into view the 
figure of an armed guard at the 
door. The figure of a corporal, 
grim in battle dress. 



Curt looked up, sick as if some 
inner sense had divined the mean- 
ing of that scene which he could 
not yet put into words. 

"Had enough?” asked Sark. 
"What does it mean?” 

"That is Dell as he would have 
been. That is what he was willing 
to die to avoid.” 

"But what is it?” 

"A military research laboratory 
twelve years into your future. You 
are aware that in your own time 
a good deal of research has come 
to a standstill because many first- 
string scientists have revolted 
against military domination. Un- 
fortunately, there are plenty of 
second-stringers available and they 
are enough for most tasks — the 
youngsters with new Ph. D.s who 
are awed by the glitter of golden 
laboratories. But, lacking experience 
or imagination, they can’t ■ see 
through the glitter or have the in- 
sight for great work. Some will 
eventually, too late, however, and 
they will be replaced by eager new 
youngsters.” 

"This scene of Dell — ” 

"Just twelve years from what 
you call now. Deadlier weapons 
will be needed and so a bill will 
be passed to draft the reluctant 
first-line men — against their will, 
if necessary.” 

"You can’t force creative 
work,” Curt objected. 

Sark shrugged. "There are 
drugs that do wonderful and 
terrible things to men’s minds. 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



They can force creation or mind- 
less destruction, confession or out- 
rageous subterfuge. You saw your 
opponents make some use of them. 
A cardinal, for example, and an 
engineer, among others. Now you 
have seen your friend, Dell, as 
he would have been. Not the same 
drugs, of course, but the end re- 
sult is the same.” 

Curt’s horror turned to stub- 
born disbelief. "America would- 
n't use such methods,” he said 
flatly. 

"Today? No,” agreed Sark. 
"But when a country is committed 
to inhuman warfare — even though 
the goal may be honorable — 
where is the line to stop at? Each 
brutality prepares the way for the 
next. Even concentration camps 
and extermination centers become" 
logical necessities. You have heard 
your opponents say that the end 
justifies the means. You have seen 
for yourself — the means become 
the end.” 

"But Dell could have escaped,” 
Curt protested. "You could have 
helped him to your own time or 
another. He was still valuable. He 
needn’t have died!” 

"There is no such thing as ac- 
tual travel in time,” explained 
Sark. "Or at least in our day we 
have found none. There is possible 
only a bending back of a branch 
of the Prime Continuum so that 
we can witness, warn, instruct, 
gain aid in saving the future. And 
there can be meeting only in this 



narrow sector of unreality where 
the branch joins the main stream. 
Our farms adjoin such sectors, but 
farther than that we cannot go, nor 
can one of you become a citizen 
of the world you have created for 
us. 

"But I wish it were so!” Sark 
bit out venomously. "We’d kid- 
nap you by the millions, force you 
to look upon the ruin and the 
horror, let you breathe the atmos- 
phere that no man can inhale and 
live, the only atmosphere there is 
in that world. Yes, I wish you 
could become our guests there. 
Our problem would be easier. But 
it can’t be done. This is the only 
way we can work. 

"Dell had to go. There was no 
escape for him, no safety for us 
if he lived. He would have been 
tracked down, captured like a 
beast and set to work against his 
will. It was there in the Prime 
Continuum. Nothing could cancel 
it except death, the death that 
saves a billion lives because he will 
not produce a toxin deadlier than 
D. triconus.” 

3 1 HE vengeance in Sark’s voice 
. was almost tangible. Involun- 
tarily Curt retreated a step before 
it. And — almost — he thought he 
understood these men out of time. 

"What is there — ” he began 
Jiparsely and had to stop. "What 
there that I can do?” 

"We need you to take over 
Dell’s farm. It is of key impor-

tance. The list of men he was 
treating was an extremely vital one. 
That work cannot be interrupted 
now.” 

''.How can you accomplish any- 
thing by operating only here?” 
Curt objected. "While you stifle 
our defenses, our enemies are 
arming to the teeth. When you’ve 
made us sufficiently helpless, 
they’ll strike.” 

"Did I say we were so restrict- 
ed?” answered Sark, smiling for 
the first time. "You cannot imagine 
what a fresh vegetable means on 
a professor’s table in Moscow. In 
Atomgrad a ripe tomato is worth 
a pound of uranium. How do I 
know? Because I walked the 
streets of Atomgrad with my 
grandfather.” 

"Then you’re a — ” 

Sark’s face grew hard and bitter 
in the half light of the room. 
"Was,” he corrected. "Or might 
have been. There are no nationali- 
ties where there are no nations, 
no political parties where there are 
only hunger and death. The crime 
of the future is not any person’s 
or country’s. It is the whole of 
humanity’s.” 

An alarm sounded abruptly. 

"Carlson!” someone tensely ex- 
claimed. 

Sark whirled to the panels and 
adjusted the controls. A small 
screen lighted, showing the image 
of a man with graying hair aid 
imperious face. His sharp eyfes 
seemed to burn directly into Curt’s. 



"How did it go?” exclaimed 
Sark. "Was the Prime Continuum 
shift as expected?” 

"No! It still doesn’t compute 
out. Nothing’s right. The war is 
still going on. The Continuum is 
absolute hell.” 

"I should have known,” said 
Sark in dismay. ”1 should have 
called you.” 

"What is it? Do you know 
what’s wrong?” 

"Johnson. Dr. Curtis Johnson. 
He’s here.” 

R AGE spread upon Carlson’s 
face. An oath exploded from 
his lips. "No wonder the situation 
doesn’t compute with him out of 
the Prime Continuum. Why did 
he come there?" 

• "Dell sent him. Dell died too 
quickly. He didn’t have time to 
instruct Johnson. I have told him 
what we want of him.” 

"Do you understand?” Carlson 
demanded of Curt with abruptness 
that was almost anger. 

Curt looked slowly about the 
room and back to the face of his 
questioner. Understand ? If they 
sent him back, allowed him to go 
back, could he ever be sure that 
he had not witnessed a thing of 
nightmare in this shadowy dream 
world ? 

Yes, he could be sure. He had 
seen the blasted city, just the way 
he knew it could be — would be 
unless someone prevented it. He 
had seen the pattern on the scope,

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



attuned to the tiny tributary of the 
Prime Continuum that was the life 
of Dr. Dell, had seen it run out, 
dying as Dell had died. 

He could believe, too, that there 
was a little farm near Atomgrad, 
where a tomato on a scientist’s 
table was more potent than the 
bombs building in the arsenal. 

"I understand,” he said. “Shall 
I go back now?” 

Sark put a paper into his hands. 
"Here is a list of new names. You 
will find Dell’s procedures and 
records in his desk at the farm. Do 
not underestimate the importance 
of your work. You have seen the 
failure of the Prime Continuum 
to compute properly with you out 
of it. You will correct that. 

"Your only contact from now 
on will be through Brown, who 
will bring the tank truck once a 
year. You know what to do. You 
are on your own.” 

It was like a surrealist painting 
as he left. The moon had risen, 
and in all the barrenness there 
was nothing but the gray cement 
cube of the building. The light 
spilling through the open door- 
way touched the half dozen gaunt 
men who had followed him out to 
the car. Ahead was the narrow 
band of roadway leading through 
some infinite nothingness that 
would end in Dell’s truck farm. 

H E STARTED off. When he 
looked back a moment later, 
the building was no longer there. 



He glanced at the list of names 
Sark gave him, chilled by the im- 
portance of those men. For some 
there would be death as there had 
been for Dell. For himself — 

He had forgotten to ask. But 
perhaps they would not have told 
him. Not at this time, anyway. 
The chemically treated food pro- 
duced tumors in refractory, unre- 
sponsive cells. He had eaten Dell’s 
vegetables, would eat more. 

It was too late to ask and it 
didn’t matter. He had important 
things to do. First would be the 
writing of his resignation to the 
officials of Camp Detrick. 

As of tomorrow, he would be 
Dr. Curtis Johnson, truck farmer, 
specialist in atomic-age produce, 
luscious table gifts for the inno- 
cent and not-so-innocent human 
matches that would, if he and his 
unknown colleagues succeeded, be 
prevented from cremating the 
hopes of Mankind. 

Louise would help him hang the 
new sign: 

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT 
Eat the Best 
EAT JOHNSON'S 
VEGETABLES 

Only, of course, she wouldn’t 
know why he had taken Dell’s job, 
nor could he ever explain. 

It would probably be the death 
of Curt Johnson, but that was 
cheap enough if humanity sur- 
vived. —RAYMOND F. JONES

rj t 

Artillery shells once had your number on them or they 
didn't. That was before Felix the Heat-Seeker & Co. 



I T HAPPENED about six years 
ago in a research laboratory on 
the Atlantic Coast. Somebody 
of importance, a VIP in military 
parlance, had announced his visit. 



He arrived in time for lunch, and 
the engineers, talking in relays, 
used the opportunity to fill the 
VIP with technical lore. Among 
other things, he w.as told that they 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




would show him "Felix the Heat- 
seeker." When the time came he 
was ushered into an empty room. 
In the center of that room there 
was a turntable and on the turn- 
table rested a bomb, staring at the 
visitor through a lens in its nose. 
Feeling slightly uneasy, the VIP 
took a few steps to the right. The 
bomb swung around on the turn- 
table, pointing at him again, star- 
ing. He moved to the left. The 
bomb turned after him, staring 
w'ith the lens in its nose — • 



This was, after all, a perfectly 
natural thing, because Felix the 
Heat-seeker was reacting to the 
VIP’s body temperature, which 
may have gone up a degree or two 
because of this performance. The 
somewhat nerve-racking demon- 
stration was, in part, a device for 
being remembered in the budget. 
In addition to that it was a kind 
of summary of recent develop- 
ments in military technology, a lec- 
ture with the theme that it is no 
longer true that "a miss of an inch 



TWENTY-FOOT MISS 



87 



is as good as a mile.” The saying 
should now be that a twenty-foot 
miss is a clean hit. 

That came about in three ways. 

The first, simplest and also old- 
est is the exploding charge. If a 
solid cannonball missed a soldier 
by six inches, he could shrug and 
continue charging. If, later on, a 
105mm. howitzer shell exploded 
at a distance of six feet from the 
soldier, it was a hit. The biggest 
application of this principle is, of 
course, the fission bomb, which, 
for this very reason, can't even be 
a front line weapon any more. 

The second way of transform- 
ing a miss into a hit is essentially 
an addition to the exploding 
charge. It is what may be called 
the "sensing” fuze,* which will 
perceive the nearness of a target 
and respond at the precise frac- 
tional instant of closest approach. 

The third, finally, is to correct 
the trajectory of whatever you are 
throwing at your enemy, prior to 
missing the target, so that the 
throw is turned into a hit. As far 
as strict chronological sequence 
goes, the third method was thought 
of and even tested before the sec- 
ond, but the second, the sensing 
fuze, was used first. 

I T APPEARED in action during 
the early days of the Second. 
World War, just when the war

guish it from a FUSE, which is an electric 
safety device. 



looked quite leisurely. The mani- 
festation of the new principle in 
military technology was called a 
"magnetic mine,” which is hardly 
a good name, for the device hap- 
pened to be as non-magnetic as 
possible. Up to that moment all 
military engineers had known that 
a fuze (unless it happened to be 
a time fuze) had to make "con- 
tact” to be set off. That was still 
true, but it had always been taken 
for granted that any contact would 
be a physical one. That there could 
also be a contact of force fields 
was new. 

The fuze of the so-called mag- 
netic mine relied on the simple 
fact that the earth has a magnetic 
field. The best known manifesta- 
tion of that field is that it makes 
a magnetic needle assume an ap- 
proximate North-South position, 
as in a compass. But if there is a 
large mass of iron nearby — for ex- 
ample, a ship — the earth's mag- 
netic field is disturbed for some 
distance and the compass needle 
misbehaves. Any schoolbook says 
so, but the Germans applied the 
information lethally. 

They built a naval mine of non- 
magnetic materials, mostly alum- 
inum, gave it the shape of an air- 
plane bomb so that bombers could 
plant it, and put a fuze inside 
which would go off when a mag- 
netic needle was disturbed. Such a 
disturbance meant that there was 
a large mass of iron nearby — 
again, for example, a ship. They 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



also had a safety catch on that 
fuze, consisting of a so-called 
hydrostatic switch, a device which 
prevented the fuze from working 
unless it was under water which 
opened the switch by its pressure. 

It was the undoing of the 
scheme that one of these para- 
chuted mines did not fall into 
water but landed on a mudbank.

approached the monster with a kit 
of non-magnetic tools, mainly 
bronze. He opened up the mine, 
giving a running account of his 
actions through a microphone so 
that, in case of accident, the next 
mine opener would know what had 
been done wrong. He was both 
skilful and lucky, since he hap- 
pened to be protected by the faith- 
ful functioning of the hydrostatic 
switch. The Allies then knew how 
such a mine worked: it just sat in 
the bottom mud of shallow water, 
waiting for a ship to come close. 

Once the principle of operation 
was known, counter-measures were 
not too difficult. Simultaneously the 
torpedo experts at Newport, R. I., 
began to think about disturbed- 
force fields. Torpedoes, if they 
scored a hit, were very effective 
weapons. They were also very ex- 
pensive weapons, which point was 
usually remembered when a tor- 
pedo made a near miss. The result 
of the thinking about near misses 
and disturbed force fields was that 
the torpedo was cross-bred with an 
advanced magnetic mine. 



T HE offspring was the Torpedo 
Mark XIV with magnetic 
fuze. It would explode when pass- 
ing under a ship of shallow draft, 
and it would explode even when 
crossing the bow or stern. Perfor- 
mance was marred at first by a 
mistake in calibration of the early 
production models, and sailors 
made remarks featuring the word 
"long-hairs” — which they quickly 
took back when the device was 
made to work. 

The most famous example of 
sensing fuzes operated above the 
water line. I mean what the mili- 
tary call the VT fuze. It means 
"variable time,” though engineers 
are more likely to call it "prox- 
imity fuze.” That fuze is some- 
thing which is a bit hard to be- 
lieve, not so much because of its 
action, which makes it go off in 
the proximity of a target, but be- 
cause it is really a radio set. 

You don’t expect a radio set to 
be still in one piece, or even in 
working order, after it has been 
shot from a gun. But the VT fuze, 
after some 800 million dollars 
were spent on its development, re- 
mains in working order. In fact, 
it is not in working order before 
firing; it needs the shock of firing 
and the spinning of the shell to 
activate its battery. 

The working principle may 
again be called that of a disturbed 
force field, but it is utilized some- 
what differently. When the battery 
has been activated, the fuze sends 



TWENTY-FOOT MISS 



89 



out a steady radio signal that 
forms a kind of aura. As long as 
nothing enters the aura, nothing 
will happen. But when the shell 
comes close to an airplane, radio 
waves are reflected back to the 
fuze. A special tube in the fuze 
senses the reflection and builds up 
resentment in the form of a charge. 
When the charge has grown 
strong enough — all this taking 
place in fractions of a second — 
this tube sets off a detonator. The 
detonator explodes a booster 
charge and the shock of the ex- 
ploding booster makes the TNT 
of the main charge go off. Which 
is the end of the VT fuze and its 
radio aura, but usually also the end 
of the obstacle in the aura. 

These VT fuzes accomplished 
quite incredible feats during the 
Second World War. At Anzio 
Beach they downed 691 Luftwaffe 
planes, aided by a gun-directing 
mechanism known to ordnance per- 
sonnel as the M-9. But the impor- 
tant point is not the large figure. 
It is that out of these 691 hits, 
some 680 were in all probability 
near misses, old style! 

H OWEVER, there must have 
been an additional number of 
actual misses beyond the range of 
action of the VT fuze, for once a 
shell had left the gun muzzle, it 
was on its own. To influence - it 
even after it had been fired was 
the goal of the third method. 

The third method, that of guid- 



ing a lethal missile, cropped up 
for the first time in 1911. It was, 
of all places, in a circus in Berlin. 
They had a model of a Zeppelin 
airship there, about 15 feet long. 
When the time for the act came, a 
console was carried into the arena 
and the inventor closed one switch. 
The battery-powered electric mo- 
tors of the airship model began 
to whir and the ship moved. A 
second switch was closed and the 
airship model flew in a curve. A 
third switch was closed; the air- 
ship dropped a small bomb, which 
exploded with red flames and 
much smoke in the sawdust. 

Some time later, the same in- 
ventor demonstrated a motorboat 
which he ran by wireless signals 
from the shore of the lake. He 
pointed out that this would be a 
fine method for sending explosive- 
laden ships into enemy harbors or 
fleet formations. Probably because 
the range was very short and the 
signals could easily have been 
"jammed,” these unmanned super- 
torpedoes failed to materialize dur- 
ing the First World War. After 
that war, however, the Germans 
utilized the idea in their famous 
Ziihringen, a small warship with 
full armor but minus guns. Equip- 
ped with radio steering gear -and 
all empty spaces stuffed with cork, 
the Ziihringen did long service as 
a mobile target ship. 

People who have read Goethe’s 
Faust like to quote the lines: "All 
theory, my friend, is gray; but life

a flowering green tree.” It may be 
true in some cases, but when it 
comes to the guiding of missiles it 
works the other way round. It all 
foots fine an d lush in theory. In 
real life performance, things be- 
gin to look dark. When Dr. Ralph 
E. Gibson of the Applied Physics 
Laboratory in Silver Springs, Md., 
was interviewed recently, one re- 
porter asked how far one could 
fire a missile now. Doctor Gibson 
was willing to concede some 500 
miles or a little more. And for what 
distance, asked another reporter, 
would you guarantee a hit? Ten 
feet, snapped Dr. Gibson. This I 
consider somewhat understated; he 
could have guaranteed a hit for 
the length of the missile itself. 

F ACT is, in the Second World 
War, the only guided mis- 
siles used operationally were those 
released from aircraft, where con- 
ditions are somewhat simpler. There 
were ground-to-ground missiles, 
like V-l and V-2, but they were 
not guided. In the V-l, a robot 
pilot maintained the flying bomb 
on a straight course and at a given 
altitude. In the V-2, an automatic 
device saw to it that the power was 
shut off when the rocket had 
reached the proper velocity, which 
is, actually, the equivalent of doling 
out the right powder charge for a 
big gun. 

Of true guiding there were only 
beginnings. As an example 1 might 
mention a large anti-aircraft rocket 



that was supposed to form part of 
the German Rhineland defense. 
Naturally, the rocket was named 
Rheintocbter or Rhine Maiden. The 
idea was that when an allied bomb- 
er would be caught in a radar beam, 
a Rhine Maiden would be fired im- 
mediately and be trailed by a second 
beam, through which it would re- 
ceive directional orders. Then the 
two beams would be brought to- 
gether. 

It did not work too well and 
most experts now believe that this 
was not due to wartime hurry, but 
that the system itself was at fault. 
Those who think so prefer the "one- 
beam system,” in which the anti- 
aircraft missile is fed into the same 
beam that has caught the attacker. 
The missile receives no orders from 
the ground, but is equipped with a 
mechanism that will always shunt 
it back into its beam. 

Doctor Gibson calls that "con- 
science guiding,” the missile being 
unable to stray from the narrow 
path leading to the enemy. Using 
only one beam, this method is not 
merely simpler, it has another ad- 
vantage. Since one can feed several 
missiles in succession into the beam, 
the enemy would not have won out 
by default just because a single 
missile’s conscience slipped. All 
that would be needed for final suc- 
cess would be a radar man on the 
grttund who did not lose his target. 

But why not just send the mis- 
sile aloft in the general direction 
of the enemy and entrust a device 



TWENTY-FOOT MISS

like Felix the Heat-seeker with the 
actual hunting? Well, during that 
demonstration the engineers had 
been careful to leave Felix alone 
with just one source of heat radia- 
tion. In real action there would be 
so many heat sources that any de- 
vice would be confused. It would 
have to be brought pretty close to 
the intended prey until it could 
take over. And even then it might 
be useful only against an attacking 
unmanned missile. If it tried to 
chase a manned bomber, sniffing 
either for the heat of its exhaust or 
the noise of its engines, the crew 
could do something about it. 

They could, for example, drop an 
instantaneously igniting incendiary 
bomb with a parachute that keeps 
it from falling too fast. The total 
weight of such a bomb would be 
around three pounds, small enough 
to allow any plane to carry a con- 
siderable number of them. Result: 
the heat-seeking interceptor would 
suddenly get a much hotter scent 
and strain all control surfaces in 
diving wildly after the floating 
magnesium bomb, blowing it suc- 
cessfully into smaller hot splinters. 
Any competent fireworks chemist 
can compound a mixture which does 
no harm but produces a considerable 
noise while burning. Incorporated 
into a parachute bomb, that would 
take care of noise-seeking missiles. 
One can confuse the radar man on 
the ground, too, but not that easily. 

Going on from here, one could 
ask: why specific measures? Why 



not develop a field which will set 
off all VT-fuzed projectiles and 
missiles at a distance, where their 
explosion can’t cause any harm? 

F RSONALLY, I don't know if 
this can be done. I am mostly 
wondering whether a plane could 
carry the necessary equipment to 
do it. But even if it can be done 
and if the plane can carry the nec- 
essary equipment, there exists one 
kind of VT fuze that might spoil 
everything. It is the optical VT fuze 
which actually sees the plane. 

The trick is accomplished by 
having a solid lucite lens which is 
covered except for a slot running 
all around the nose. Light enters 
through the slot and is focused on 
a photo-cell. An airplane that gets 
in the way is just something that 
acts as a partial screen reducing the 
amount of light received by the 
photo-cell. The photo-cell answers 
with a change in voltage that does 
what the reflected radio waves do 
in the other type. 

If you now feel like the VIP 
who was left alone with Felix, you 
find yourself in large company. All 
these developments took place so 
fast that nobody has been able to 
think his way through. And if 
there should be a good partial an- 
swer, it is not likely to be pub- 
lished. But it looks as if attack and 
defense are better matched than 
they were in 1940. By hard work 
and ingenuity, things may be kept 
that way. —WILLY LEY

THE WAKER DREAMS 

BY RICHARD MATHESON 

There's nothing like exciting fantasy to escape boredom, • 
The problem is to know whether it's actually a fantasy. 



I F ONE flew over the city at 
this time of this day, which was 
like any other day in the year 
3850, one would think all life had 
disappeared. 

Sweeping over the rustless spires, 
one would search in vain for the 
sight of human activity. One’s gaze 
would scan the great ribboned 
highways that swept over and un- 
der each other like the weave of 
some tremendous loom. But there 
would be no autocars to see; noth- 
ing but the empty lanes and the 
colored traffic lights clicking out 
their mindless progressions. 



Dipping low and weaving in and 
out among the glittering towers, 
one might see the moving walks, 
the studied revolution of the giant 
street ventilators, hot in the winter 
and cool in summer, the tiny doors 
opening and closing, the park 
fountains shooting their methodical 
columns of water into the air. 

Farther along, one would flit 
across the great open field on which 
the glossy spaceships stood lined 
before their hangars. Farther yet, 
one would catch sight of the river, 
the metal ships resting along shore, 
delicate froth streaming from their 



THE WAKER DREAMS

sterns caused by the never-ending 
operation of their vents. 

Again, one would glide over the 
city proper, seeking some sign of 
life in the broad avenues, the net- 
work of streets, the painstaking 
pattern of dwellings in the living 
area, the metal fastness of the com- 
mercial section. 

The search would be fruitless. 

All movement below would be 
seen to be mechanical. And, know- 
ing what city this was, one’s eyes 
would stop the search for citizens 
and seek out those squat metal 
structures which stood a half mile 
apart. These circular buildings 
housed the never-resting machines, 
the humming geared servants of 
the city’s people. 

These were the machines that 
did all; cleared the air of impun- 
ities, moved the walks and opened 
the doors, sent their synchronized 
impulses into the traffic lights, 
operated the fountains and the 
spaceships, the river vessels and 
the ventilators. 

These were the machines in 
whose flawless efficacy the people 
of the city placed their casual faith. 

At the moment, these people 
were resting on their pneumatic 
couches in rooms. And the music 
that seeped from their wall speak- 
ers, the cool breezes that flowed 
from their wall ventilators, the very 
air they breathed — all these were 
of and from the machines, the un- 
failing, the trusted, the infallible 
machines. 



Now there was a buzzing in ears. 
Now the city came alive. 

T HERE was a buzzing, buzzing. 

From the black swirl of slum- 
ber, you heard it. You wrinkled up 
your classic nose and twitched the 
twenty neural rods that led to the 
highways of your extremities. 

The sound bore deeper, cut 
through swaths of snooze and 
poked an impatient finger in the 
throbbing matter of your brain. 
You twisted your head on the pil- 
low and grimaced. 

There was no cessation. With 
stupored hand, you reached out and 
picked up the receiver. One eye 
propped open by dint of will, you 
breathed a weary mutter into the 
mouthpiece. 

"Captain Rackley!” The knifing 
voice put your teeth on edge. 
"Yes,” you said. 

"You will report to your com- 
pany headquarters immediately!” 
That swept away sleep and an- 
noyance as a petulant old man 
brushes chessmen from his board. 
Stomach muscles drew into play 
and you were sitting. Inside your 
noble chest, that' throbbing meat 
ball, source of blood velocity, saw 
fit to swell and depress with 
marked emphasis. Your sweat 
glands engaged in proper activity, 
ready for action, danger, heroism. 
"Is it . ?” you started. 
"Report immediately!” the voice 
crackled, and there was a severe 
click in your ear.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



You, Justin Rackley, dropped the 
receiver — plunko — in its cradle and 
leaped from bed in a shower of 
fluttering bedclothes. 

You raced to your wardrobe door 
and flung it open. Plunging into 
the depths, you soon emerged with 
your skintight pants, the tunic for 
your forty-two chest. You donned 
said trousers and tunic, flopped 
upon a nearby seat and plunged 
your arches into black military 
boots. 

A ND your face reflected oh-so- 
grim thoughts. Combing out 
your thick blond hair, you were 
sure you knew what the emergency 
was. 

The Rustons ! They were at it 
again ! 

Awake now, you wrinkled your 
nose with conscious aplomb. The 
Rustons made revolting food for 
thought with their twelve legs, 
sign of alien progenitors, and their 
exudation of foul reptilian slime. 

As you scurried 'from your room, 
leaped across the balustrade and 
down the stairs, you wondered once 
again where these awful Rustons 
had originated, what odious inter- 
breeding produced their monster 
race. You wondered where they 
lived, where proliferated their gris- 
ly stock, held their meetings of 
war, began the upward slither to 
those great Earth fissures from 
which they massed in attack. 

With nothing approaching an- 
swers to these endless questions, 



you ran out of the dwelling and 
flew down the steps to your faith- 
ful autocar. Sliding in, pushing 
buttons, levers, pedals, what have 
you, you soon had it darting 
through the streets toward the 
broad highway that led to head- 
quarters. 

At this time of day, naturally, 
there were very few people about. 
In point of fact you saw none. It 
was only a few minutes later, when 
you turned sharply and zoomed up 
the ramp to the highway, that you 
saw the other autocars whizzing to- 
ward the tower five miles distant. 
You guessed, and were correct in 
guessing, that they were fellow 
officers, all similarly ripped from 
slumber by mobilization. 

Buildings flew past as you 
pushed pedals deeper into their 
cavities, your face always grim, 
alive to danger, grand warrior! 
True, you were not averse to the 
chance for activity after a month 
of idleness. But the circumstances 
were slightly distasteful. To think 
of the Rustons made a fellow 
shudder, eh? 

What made them pour from 
their unknown pits? Why did they 
seek to destroy the machines, let 
the acid canker of their ooze eat 
through metal, make the teeth fall 
off the gears like petals off a dying 
flower? What was their purpose? 
Did they mean to ruin the city? 
Govern its inhabitants? Or slaugh- 
ter them? Ugly questions, ques- 
tions without answers. 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



?5 



Well, you thought as you drove 
into headquarters parking area, 
thank heaven the Rustons had only 
managed to get at a few of the 
outer machines, yours blessedly not 
included. 

They, at least, had no more idea 
than you where the Great Machine 
was, that fabulous fountainhead of 
energy, driver of all machines. 

You slid the seat of your military 
trousers across the seat of the auto- 
car and jumped out into the wide 
lot. Your black boots clacked as 
you ran toward the entrance. Other 
officers were getting out of auto- 
cars, too, running across the area. 
None of them said anything; they 
all looked grim. Some of them 
nodded curtly at you as you all 
stood together in the rising eleva- 
tor. Bad business, you thought. 

With a tug at the groin, the 
door gave a hydraulic gasp and 
opened. You stepped out and 
padded silently down the hall to 
the high-ceilinged briefing room. 

Already the room was almost 
filled. The young men, invariably 
handsome and muscular, stood in 
gregarious formations, discussing ' 
the Rustons in low voices. The gray 
soundproof walls sucked in their 
comments and returned dead air. 

T HE men gave you a look and a 
nod when you entered, then re- 
turned to their talking. Justin Rack- 
ley, captain, that’s you, sat down 
in a front seat. 

Then you looked up. The door 



to Upper Echelons was. jerked 
open. The General came striding 
through, a sheaf of papers in his 
square fist. His face was grim too. 

He stepped up on the rostrum 
and slapped the papers on the thick 
table which stood there. Then he 
plumped down on the edge of it 
and kicked his boot against one of 
its legs until all your fellow officers 
had broken up their groups and 
hurriedly taken seats. With silence 
creeping over all heads, he pursed 
his lips and banged a palm on the 
table surface. 

"Gentlemen,” he said with that 
voice which seemed to issue from 
an ancient tomb, "once more the 
city lies in grave danger." 

He then paused and looked 
capable of handling all emergen- 
cies. You hoped that someday you 
might be General and look capa- 
ble of handling all emergencies. No 
reason why not, you thought. 

"I will not take up precious 
time,” the General went on, taking 
up precious time. "You all know 
your positions, you all know your 
responsibilities. When this briefing 
is concluded, you will report to the 
arsenal and draw out your ray guns. 
Always remember that the Rustons 
must not be allowed to enter the 
machinery and live. Shoot to kill. 
The rays are not harmful, repeat, 
not harmful to the machinery.”' 

He looked over you eager young 
men. 

"You also know," he said, "the 
dangers of Ruston poisoning. For 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this reason, that the slightest touch 
of their stingers can lead to abys- 
mal agonies of death, you will be 
assigned, as you also know, a nurse 
trained in the combating of syST 
temic poisons. Therefore, after 
leaving the arsenal, you will report 
to the Preventive Section.” 

He winked, a thoroughly out-of- 
place wink. 

"And remember,” he said, with 
a broad roll of import in his voice, 
"this is war! And only war!" 

This, of course, brought on ap- 
preciative smiles, a smattering of 
leers and many unmilitary asides. 
Upon which the General snapped 
out of his brief role as chuckling 
confrere and returned to strict au- 
tocratic detachment. 

"Once assigned a nurse, those of 
you whose machines are more than 
fifteen miles from the city will re- 
port to the spaceport, there to be 
assigned a spacecar. All of you will 
then proceed with utmost dispatch. 
Questions?” 

No questions. 

"I need hardly remind you,” 
completed the General, "of the im- 
portance of this defense. As you 
are well aware, should the Rustons 
penetrate our city, spread their rav- 
aging to the core of our machine 
system, should they — heaven for- 
fend! — locate the Great Machine, 
wc may then expect nothing but 
the most merciless of butchery. The 
city would be undone, we would all 
be annihilated, Man would be over- 
thrown.” 



T HE men looked at him with 
clenched fists, patriotism lurch- 
ing through their brains like 
drunken satyrs, yours included, 
Justin Rackley. 

"That is all,” said the General, 
waving his hand. "Good shooting.” 
He jumped down from the plat- 
form and swept through the door- 
way, the door opening magically a 
split second before his imperious 
nose stood to shatter on its surface. 

You stood up, muscles tingling. 
Onward! Save our fair city! 

You stepped through the broken 
ranks. The elevator again, standing 
shoulder to shoulder with your 
comrades, a fluttering sense of 
hyper-awareness coursing your 
healthy young body. 

The arsenal room. Sound lost in 
the heavily padded interior. You, 
on line, grim-faced always, shuffling 
along, weapon bound. A counter; it 
was like an exchange market. You 
showed the man your identity card 
and he handed you a shiny ray gun 
and a shoulder case of extra ray 
pellets. 

Then you passed through the 
door and scuffed down the rubber- 
ized steps'to the Preventive Section. 
Corpuscles took a carnival ride 
through your veins. 

You were fourth in line and she 
was fourth in line; that’s how she 
j^as assigned to you. 

-JjjYou perused her contours, not- 
uittg! that her uniform, although 
similar to yours, somehow hung 
differently on her. This sidetracked 



THE WAKER DREAMS

martial contemplations for the 
nonce. Zotvie hoopla — your libido 
clapped its calloused hands. 

"Captain Rackley,” said the man, 
"this is Miss Lieutenant Forbes. 
She is your only guarantee against 
death should you be stung by a 
Ruston. See that she remains close 
by at all times.” 

This seemed hardly an onerous 
commission and you saluted the 
man. You then exchanged a flicker 
of lids with the young lady and 
intoned a gruff command, relative 
to departure. This roused the two 
of you to walk to the elevator. 

Riding down in silence, you cast 
glances at her. Long forgotten 
threnodies twitched into life in 
your revitalized brain. You were 
much taken by the dark ringlets 
that hung over her forehead and 
massed on her shoulders like 
curled black fingers. Her eyes, you 
noted, were brown and soft as eyes 
in a dream. And why shouldn’t 
they be? 

Yet something lacked. Some re- 
tardation kept bringing you down 
from ethereal cogitation. Could it, 
you wondered, be duty? And, re- 
membering what you were out to 
do, you suddenly feared again. The 
pink clouds marched away in mili- 
tary formation. 

Miss Lieutenant Forbes re- 
mained silent until the spacecar 
which you were assigned was flit- 
ting across the sky beyond the out- 
skirts of the city. Then, following 
your somewhat banal overtures re- 



garding the weather, she smiled 
her pretty little smile and showed 
her pretty little dimples. 

"I am but sixteen,” she an- 
nounced. 

"Then this is your first time.” 
"Yes,” she replied, gazing afar. 
"I am very frightened.” 

You nodded, you patted her 
knee with what you meant to be a 
parental manner, but which, post- 
haste, brought the crimson of mod- 
esty flaming into her cheeks. 

"Just stay close to me,” you said, 
trying hard for a double meaning. 
"I'll take care of you.” 

Primitive, but good enough for 
sixteen. She blushed more deeply. 

The city towers flashed beneath. 
Far off, like a minute button on 
the fringes of spiderweb, you saw 
your machine. You eased the wheel 
forward; the tiny ship dipped down 
and began a long glide toward 
Earth. You kept your eyes on the 
control board with strict attention, 
wondering about this strange sense 
of excitement running pell mell 
through your body, not knowing 
whether it presaged combat fatigue 
of one sort or another. 

This was war. The city first. 
Hola! 

T HE ship floated down to and 
hovored over the machine as 
you threw on the air brakes. Slow- 
ly. it sank to the roof like a butter- 
fly settling on a flower. 

You threw off the switch, heart 
pounding, all forgotten but the 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



present danger. Grabbing the ray 
gun, you jumped out and ran to the 
edge of the roof. 

Your machine was beyond the 
perimeter of the city. There were 
fields about. Your keen eyes flashed 
over the ground. 

There was no sign of the enemy. 

You hurried back to the ship. 
She was still sitting inside watch- 
ing you. You turned the knob and 
the communicator system spilled 
out its endless drones of informa- 
tion. You stood impatiently until 
the announcer spoke your machine 
number and said the Rustons were 
within a mile of it. 

You heard her drawn-in breath 
and noted the upward cast of 
frightened eyes in your direction. 
You turned off the set. 

“Come, we’ll, go inside,” you 
said, holding the ray gun in a de- 
lightfully shaking hand. It was fun 
to be frightened. A fine sense of 
living dangerously. Wasn’t that 
why you were here? 

You helped her out. Her hand 
was cold. You squeezed it and gave 
her a half smile of confidence. 
Then, locking the door to the 
spacecar, to keep the foe out, you 
took her arm and the two of you 
went down the stairs. As you en- 
tered the main room, your head 
was at once filled with the smooth 
hum of machinery. 

Here, at this juncture of the ad- 
venture, you put down your ray 
gun and ammunition and explained 
the machinery to her. It is to be 



noted that you had no particular 
concern for the machinery as you 
spoke, being more aware of her 
proximity. Such charm, such youth, 
crying out for comfort. 

You soon held her hand again. 
Then you had your arm around . her 
lithesome waist and she was close. 
Something other than military de- 
fense planned itself in your mind. 

Came the moment when she 
flicked up her drowsy lids and 
looked you smack-dab in the eye, 
as is the archaic literary passage. 
You found her violet eyes some- 
what unbalancing. You drew her 
closer. The perfume of her rosy 
breath tied casual knots in your 
limbs. And yet there was still some- 
thing holding you back. 

Swish! Slap! 

She stiffened and cried out. 

The Rustons were at the walls! 

Y OU raced for the table upon 
which your ray gun rested. On 
the couch next to the table was 
your ammunition. You slung the 
case over your shoulder. She ran 
up to you and, sternly, you handed 
her the preventive case. You felt 
like the self-assured General when 
he was in a grim mood. 

"Keep the needles loaded and 
handy,” you said. "I may . .” 
The sentence died as another 
great slobbering Ruston slapped 
against the wall. The sound of its 
huge suckers slurped on the out- 
side. They were searching for the 
machinery in the basement. 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



99 



You checked the gun. It was 
ready. 

"Stay here,” you muttered. "I 
have to go down.” 

You didn’t hear what she said. 
You dashed down the stairs and 
came bouncing out into the base- 
ment just as the first horror gushed 
over the edge of a window onto its 
metal floor like a stream of gravity- 
defying lava. 

T HE row of blinking yellow eyes 
turned on you; your flesh 
crawled. The great brown-gold 
monstrosity began to scuttle across 
toward the machines with an oily 
squish. You almost froze in fear. 

Then instinct came to the fore. 
You raised the gun quickly. A 
crackling brilliantine blue ray 
leaped from the muzzle, touched 
the scaly body and enveloped it. 
Screeching and the smell of frying 
oil filled the air. When the ray had 
dissipated, the dead Ruston lay 
black and smoking on the floor, its 
slime running across the welded 
seams. 

You heard the sound of suckers 
behind. You whirled, blasted the 
second of the Rustons into greasy 
oblivion. Still another slid over the 
window edge and started toward 
you. Another burst from the gun 
and another scorched hulk lay 
twitching on the metal. 

You swallowed a great lump of 
excitement in your throat, your 
head snapping around, your body 
leaping from side to side. In a sec- 

100 



ond, two more of them were mov- 
ing toward you. Two bursts of ray; 
one missed. The second monster 
was almost upon you before you 
burst it into flaming chunks as it 
reared up to plunge its Black sting- 
ers in your chest. 

You turned quickly, cried out in 
horror. 

One Ruston was just slipping 
down the stairs, another swishing 
toward you, the long stingers 
aimed at your heart. You pressed 
the button. A scream caught in 
your throat. 

You were out of pellets! 

You leaped to the side and the 
Ruston fell forward. You tore 
open the case and fumbled with 
the pellets. One fell and shattered 
uselessly on the metal. Your hands 
were ice, they shook terribly. The 
blood pounded through your veins, 
your hair stood on end. You felt 
scared and amused. 

The Ruston lunged again as you 
slid the pellet into the ray gun. 
You dodged again — not enough! 
The end of one stinger slashed 
through your tunic, laid open your 
arm. You felt the burning poison 
shoot into your system. 

You pressed the button and the 
monster disappeared in a cloud of 
unguent, smoke. The basement ma- 
chinery was secure against attack — 
the Rustons had bypassed it. 

You leaped for the stairway. 
You had to save the machines, save 
her, save yourself! 

Your boots banged up the metal 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



chairs. You lunged into the great 
room of machines and swept a 
glance around. 

A gasp tore open your mouth. 
She was collapsed on a couch, 
sprawled, inert. A Ruston line of 
slime ran down the front of her 
swelling tunic. 

You whirled and, as you did, the 
Ruston vanished into the machin- 
ery, pushing its scaly body through 
the gear spaces. The slime dropped 
from its body and watery jaws. The 
machine stopped, started again, the 
racked wheels groaning. 

T HE city! You leaped to the ma- 
chine’s edge and shot a blast 
from the ray gun into it. The bril- 
liantine blue ray licked out, missed 
the Ruston. You fired again. The 
Ruston moved too fast, hid behind 
the wheels. You ran around the 
machine, kept on firing. 

You glanced at her. How long 
did the poison take? They never 
said. Already in your flesh, how- 
e\ er, the burning had begun. You 
felt as if you were going up in 
flames, as if great pieces of your 
body were about to fall off. 

You had to get an injection for 
yourself and her. 

Still the Ruston eluded you. You 
had to stop and put another pellet 
in the gun. The interior began to 
whirl around you; you were over- 
poweririgly dizzy. You pressed the 
button again and again. The ray 
darted into the machine. 

You reeled around with a sob 



and tore open your collar. You 
could hardly breathe. The smell of 
the singed suet, of the rays, filled 
your head. You stumbled around 
the machine, shot out another ray 
at the fast-moving Ruston. 

Then, finally, when you were 
about to keel over, you got a good 
target. You pressed the button, the 
Ruston was enveloped in flame, fell 
in ' molten bits beneath the ma- 
chine, was swallowed up by the 
waste exhaust. 

You dropped the ray gun and 
staggered over to her. 

The hypodermics were on the 
table. 

You tore open her tunic and 
jabbed a needle into her soft white 
shoulder, shudderingly injected the 
antidote into her veins. You stuck 
another into your own shoulder, 
felt the sudden coolness run 
through your flesh and your blood- 
stream. 

You sank down beside her, 
breathing heavily and closing your 
eyes. The violence of activity had 
exhausted you. You felt as though 
you would have to rest a month 
after this. And, of course, you 
would. 

She groaned. You opened your 
eyes and looked at her. Your heavy 
breathing began again, but this 
time you knew where the excite- 
ment was coming from. You kept 
looking at her. A warm heat 
lapped at your limbs, caressed your 
heart. Her eyes were on you. 

"I . you said. 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



101 



Then all holding back was end- 
ed, all doubt undone. The city, the 
Rustons, the machines — the danger 
was over and forgotten. She ran a 
caressing hand over your cheek. 

<< A ND when next you opened 
ii-your eyes,” finished the doc- 
tor, "you were back in this room.” 
Rackley laughed, his head quiv- 
ering on the pillow, his hands 
twitching in glee. 

"But my dear doctor,” he 
laughed, "how fantastically clever 
of you to know everything. How- 
ever do you do it, naughty man?” 
The doctor looked down at the 
tall handsome man who lay on the 
bed, still shaking with breathless 
laughter. 

"You forget,” he said, "I inject 
you. Quite natural that I should 
know what happens then.” 

"Oh, quite! Quite!” cried Justin 
Rackley. "Oh, it was utterly, utter- 
ly fantastic. Imagine me!” He ran 
strong fingers over the swelling bi- 
ceps of his arm. "Me, a hero!” 

He clapped his hands together 
and deep laughter rumbled in his 
chest, his white teeth flashed against 
the glowing tan of his face. The 
sheet slipped, revealing the broad 
suppleness of his chest, the tightly 
ridged stomach muscles. 



into a bloodless fist. The thought- 
plunged a cruel knife into his brain 
— this is the end of our race, the 
sorry peak of Man’s evolution. This 
is the final corruption. 

Rackley yawned and stretched 
his arms. "I must rest.” He peered 
up at the doctor. "It was such a 
fatiguing dream.” 

He began to giggle, his great 
blond head lolling on the pillow. 
His hands striking at the sheet as 
though he would die of amuse- 
ment. 

"Do tell me,” he gasped, "what 
on earth have you in those utterly 
delightful injections? I’ve asked 
you so often.” 

The doctor picked up his plastic 
bag. "Merely a combination of 
chemicals designed to exacerbate 
the adrenals on one hand and, on 
the other, to inhibit the higher 
brain centers. In short,” he fin- 
ished, "a potpourri of intensifica- 
tion and reduction.” 

"Oh, you always say that,” said 
Justin Rackley. "But it is delight- 
ful. Utterly, charmingly delightful. 
You will be back in a month for 
my next dream and my dream play- 
back ?” 

The doctor blew out a weary 
gust of breath. "Yes,” he said, 
making no effort to veil his disgust. 



"Oh, dear me,” he sighed. "Dear ^'"I’ll be back next month.” 
me, what tvould this dull existence - "Thank heavens,” said Rackley, 
be without your blessed injections' I’m done with that awful Ruston 
to ease our endless boredom?” dream for another five months. 

The doctor looked coldly at him, Ugh! It’s so frightfully vile! I like 
his strong white fingers tightening the pleasanter dreams about mining 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and transporting ores from Mars 
and the Moon, and the adventures 
in food centers. They’re so much 
nicer. But . .” His lips twitched. 
"Do have more of those pretty 
young girls in them.” 

His strong, weary body twisted 
in delight. 

"Oh, do,” he murmured, his eyes 
shutting. 

He sighed and turned slowly 
and exhaustedly onto his broad, 
muscular side. 

T HE doctor walked through the 
deserted streets, his face tight 
with the old frustration. Why? 
Why? His mind kept repeating the 
word. 

Why must we continue to sus- 
tain life in the cities? For what 
purpose? Why do we not let civil- 
ization in its last outpost die as it 
means to die? Why struggle to 
keep such men alive? 

Hundreds, thousands of Justin 
Rackleys — well kept animals, me- 
chanically bred and fed and mas- 
saged into fair and handsome form. 
Mechanically restrained, too, from 
physically turning into the fat 
white slugs that, mentally, they al- 
ready were and would bodily re- 
semble if left untended. Or die. 

Why not let them? Why visit 
them every month, fill their veins 
with hypnotic drugs and sit back 
and watch them, one by one, go 
bursting into, their dream worlds 
to escape boredom? Must he end- 
lessly send his suggestions into 



their loosened brainways, fly them 
to planets and moons, crowd all 
forms of love and grand adventure 
into their mock-heroic dreams? 

The doctor slumped tiredly and 
went into another dorm-building. 
More figures, strongly or beauti- 
fully made, passive on couches. 
More dream injections. 

He made them, watched the fig- 
ures stand and stumble to the ward- 
robes. Explorers’ outfits this time, 
pith helmets and attractive shorts, 
snake boots and bared limbs. He 
stood at the window, saw them 
clamber into their autocars and 
drive away. He sat back and waited 
for them to return, knowing every 
move they would make, because he 
made them in his mind. 

They would go out to the hydro- 
ponics tanks and fight off an in- 
vasion of Energy Eaters. Bigger 
than the Rustons and made of pure 
force, they threatened to suck the 
sustenance from the plants in the 
growing trays, the living, formless 
meat swelling immortally in the nu- 
trient solutions. The Energy Eaters 
would be beaten off, of course. 
They always were. 

Naturally. They were only 
dreams. Creatures of fantastic illu- 
sion, conjured in eager dreaming 
minds by chemical magic and 
dreary scientific incantation. 

But what would all these Justin 
cRackleys say, these handsome and 
['hopeless ruins of torpid flesh, if 
they found out how they were be- 
ing fooled? 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Found out that the Rustons were 
only mental fictions for objectify- 
ing simple rust and wear and con- 
verting them into fanciful mon- 
sters. Monsters which alone could 
feebly arouse the dim instinct for 
self-preservation which just barely 
existed in this lost race. Energy 
Eaters — beetles and spores and ex- 
hausted growth solutions. Mine 
Borers — vaporous beasties that had 
to be blasted out of the Lunar and 
Martian metal deposits. And oth- 
ers, still others, all of them threats 
to that which runs and feeds and 
renews a city. 

And what would they say, these 
Justin Rackleys, upon the discovery 
that each of them, in their 
"dreams,” had done genuine man- 
ual work ? That their ray guns were 
spray guns or grease guns or air 
hammers, their death rays no more 
than streams of lubrication for rust- 
ing machines or insecticides or 
liquid fertilizer? 

What would they say if they 
found out how they were tricked 
into breeding with aphrodisiacs in 
the guise of anti-poison shots? 
How they, with no healthy interest 
in procreation, were drugged into 
the furtherance of their spineless 
strain, a strain whose only function 
was to sustain the life-giving ma- 
chines. 

I N A month he would return to 
Justin Rackley, Captain Justin 
Rackley. A month for rest, these 
people were so devoid of energy. 



It took a month to build up even 
enough strength to endure an in- 
jection of hypnotics, to oil a ma- 
chine or tend a tray, and to bring 
forth one puny cell of life. 

All for the machines, the city, 
for man . 

The doctor spat on the immacu- 
late floor of the room with the 
pneumatic couches. 

The people were the machines, 
more than the machines themselves. 
A slave race, a detestable residue, 
hopeless, without hope. 

Oh, how they would wail and 
swoon, he thought, getting grim 
pleasure in the notion, were they 
allowed to walk through that vast 
subterranean tunnel to the giant 
chamber where the Great Machine 
stood, that supposed source of all 
energy, and saw why they had to 
be tricked into working. The Great 
Machine had been designed to 
eliminate all human labor, tending 
the minor machines, the food 
plants, the mining. 

But some wise one on the Con- 
trol Council, centuries before, had 
had the wit to smash the Great 
Machine’s mechanical brain. And 
now the Justin Rackleys would have 
to see, with their own unbelieving 
eyes, the rust, the rot, the giant 
twisted death of it. But they 
wouldn’t. 

Their job was to dream of ad- 
venturous work, and work while 
dreaming. 

For how long?

TIME QUARRY 

BY CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

Conclusion of a 3-part serial 



The war in time needed bigger battalions 
to decide victory — but those battalions 
all had to be composed of one man! 



Illustrated by DAVID STONE 

SYNOPSIS 



1)2 the 80th century, Man rules 
the galaxy, but even ivitb the aid of 
billions of robots and androids — 
synthetic humans — his numbers are 
too small for more than a tenuous 
hold on all the stars and their 
planetary systems. All change, all 
danger of any sort, is a potential 
threat to the empire. One possible 
danger spot is 61 Cygni, unap- 
proachable because a shield of force 
keeps Earth ships away. 

Asher Sutton, agent of the De- 
partment of Galactic Investigation, 
is the only man who has ever 
landed on a Cygnian world. That 
was 20 years before the story opens. 
Now he returns to Earth . in a 
ship that cannot fly, with no food, 
air, or water aboard. His chief, 



Christopher Adams, is warned of 
Sutton’s return by a man who claims 
to come from the future, and who 
advises Adams to have Sutton 
killed. 

Sutton escapes assassination, but 
finds himself the center of a war in 
time, originating several centuries 
in bis future, but spreading through 
all ages of human existence. The 
war is being fought over the inter- 
pretation of a book Sutton appar- 
ently will write at some future date, 
for on two occasions he discovers 
copies of his unwritten book on 
men ivho have come back to the 
past. 

t Sutton’s book ivill state, when he 
writes it, that the inhabitants of 61 
Cygni are symbiotic abstractions — 



106

not human, not even beings in our 
sense of the word. They form mu- 
tually beneficial partnerships with 
all individual life when it comes 
into existence, and stay with it until 
it dies. In truth, they are destiny, 
the unspoken voice that attempts to 
guide every living thing in a path 
which will help to attain the great- 
est possible fulfilment. The symbi- 
otic abstractions attain a semblance 
of life in this relationship, while 
the unsuspecting host gains destiny. 
Sutton’s premise is clear and un- 
mistakable ... all forms of life 
have destiny, .not just humanity. 

To inform the intelligent, think- 
ing beings of the galaxy, Sutton 
was returned to life after his crash 
on 61 Cygni, twenty years before, 
given a secondary body that lives 
on pure energy, that cast manipulate 
objects with mental energy, and kill 
by the force of hate alone, and he 
was sent back to Earth as ambassa- 
dor. 

But it is Sutton’s premise that 
has caused the war in time. Prime 
opponents are the Revisionists, who 
want to interpret Sutton’s book as 
meaning- that only humans are ben- 
eficiaries of destiny .. Against them 
are the androids, who are human in 
all respects but one . their in- 
ability to reproduce biologically. 

In a girl named Eva Armour and 
an android named Herkimer, Sut- 
ton finds two friends. Another 
friend he could have counted on, 
Buster, his old family robot, has 
homesteaded a planet on the outer 



rim ' of the galaxy. Before going, 
Buster left a trunk for Sutton. 
Among the junk in the trunk, Sut- 
ton finds a queer wrench and an 
unopened letter, 6,000 years old. 

Opening the letter, Sutton finds 
that it was written by a John H. 
Sutton, who tells of encountering a 
man who apparently had come in a 
ship from the future. After talking 
to the man, John H. returns a few 
hours later to the scene, but finds 
the ship and the man gone. On the 
grass lies a bloodstained wrench, ap- 
parently the very wrench which Sut- 
ton had found in the trunk. A few 
days later, the letter relates, a man 
comes to the Sutton farm looking 
for work. He stays there for ten 
years and at the time of the writing, 
John H. feels certain that he is the 
man from the future, somehow ma- 
rooned in the 20th century. Fearful 
of ridicule if he told the story dur- 
ing his lifetime, John H. Sutton has 
left the letter to be opened after his 
death. Somehow it never was. 

Because of the danger to Sutton 
on Earth, Herkimer and Eva Ar- 
mour kidnap Sutton to an asteroid, 
where they plan that he will write 
his book. There, however, they find 
two men who turn out to be agents 
of the Revisionists. They offer Sut- 
ton any price he may ask if he ivill 
write the book so it will ap peas' that 
only humans are the beneficiaries of 
destiny. When he refuses, they kill 
him. 

Just as his human body is killed, 
however, he manages to switch to 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bis second, alien body, which oper- 
ates on pure energy. He destroys the 
two Revisionists and takes their 
time ship. 

Determined to prevent the at- 
tempt of the hitman race to seize 
destiny as its own, Sutton decides to 
return to the 20th century, to the 
time and place where John H. Sut- 
ton had met the man from the fu- 
ture. There, in that incident of 
6,000 years before, he feels certain, 
lies the key to the entire situation. 

Returning, he witnesses from the 
edge of a woods the meeting be- 
tween the man from the future and 
Sutton’s remote ancestor. When 
John H. leaves, Sutton approaches 
the ship. The man from the future 
is holding a wrench and Sutton 
forces him to drop it. But in the 
ensuing fight, the man regains the 
wrench and strikes at Sutton’s head. 
Even as the wrench descends upon 
his skull, Sutton realizes that not 
the man from the future, but he 
himself will be marooned in the 
20th century. 

CONCLUSION 

XXXV 

RICKED ! 

Tricked by a smooth char- 
acter from 500 years ahead 
in time. 

Tricked by a letter from 6,000 
years out of the past. 

Tricked, groaned Sutton, by my 
own muddle-headedness. 



He sat up and held his head in 
his hands and felt the westering 
Sun against his back, heard the 
squalling of a catbird in the black- 
berry patch and the sound of the 
wind as it ran along the corn rows. 

Tricked and trapped, he said 
through his teeth. 

He took his hands from his head 
and there in the trampled grass lay 
the wrench with the blood on it. 
Sutton spread out his fingers and 
blood was on them, too . , warm 
and sticky blood. Gingerly he 
touched his head with a cautious 
hand and his hair was wet and 
matted down. 

Pattern, he said viciously. It all 
runs in a pattern. 

Here I am and there is the 
wrench and just beyond the fence 
is the field of corn that is better 
than knee high on this splendid 
afternoon of July 4,- 1977. 

The ship from the future is gone 
and in another hour or so John H. 
Sutton w'ill come waddling down 
the hill to ask the questions that he 
forgot to ask before. And ten years 
from now he will write a letter and 
in it he will record his suspicions 
about me and I will be in the farm 
yard at that very moment pumping 
a drink. 

Sutton staggered to his feet and 
stood in the empty afternoon, with 
the sweep of sky above the horizon 
of the ridge and the panorama of 
the winding river far down the 
slope below. 

He touched the wrench with his 




TIME QUARRY 



109 



toe and thought: I could break the 
pattern. I could take the wrench 
and then John H. would never find 
it, and, with one thing in the pat- 
tern changed, the end might not be 
the same. 

I read the letter wrong, he 
thought. I always figured it would 
be the other man, not me. It never 
once occurred to me that it was my 
blood upon the wrench and that I 
would be the one who would steal 
the clothes off the line. 

And yet he realized there were 
certain things that didn’t track. He 
still had his clothes and there would 
be no need to steal. His ship still 
was resting on the river’s bottom 
and there was no need to stay in 
the past. 

Yet it had happened once before, 
for if it had not happened, why had 
there been the letter? The letter 
had made him come here and the 
letter had been written because he 
had come, so he must have come 
before. And in that other 'time he’d 
stayed . , and stayed only because 
he could not get away. This time he 
would go back; this time he need 
not stay. 

A second chance, he thought. 
I’ve been given another chance. 

Yet that wasn’t right, for if there 
had been a second time, old John 
H. would have known about it. 
And there couldn’t be a second 
time, for this was the very day that - 
John H. had talked to the man out j 
of the future. 

Sutton shook his head. 



There had been only one time 
that this had happened, and this, 
of course, was it. 

Something will stop me, he told 
himself. Something will not let me 
go back. Somehow I will be forced 
to steal the clothes and in the end 
I’ll walk to that farmhouse up there 
and ask if they need a hand for the 
harvest. 

For the pattern was set. It had to 
be set. 

Sutton touched the wrench with 
his toe again, pondering. 

Then he turned and went down 
the hill. Glancing over his shoulder 
as he plunged into the woods, he 
saw old John H. coming down the 
hill. 

XXXVI 

F OR three days Sutton toiled 
to free the ship from the tons 
of sand that the treacherous, 
swift-running river currents had 
mounded over it. And he admitted, 
when three days were gone, that it 
was a hopeless task, for the current 
piled up the sand as fast as he 
could clear it. 

After that, he concentrated on 
clearing an opening to the entrance 
lock and when another day went by 
with many cave-ins, he accom- 
plished his purpose. 

Wearily he braced himself 
> against the metal of the ship, 
d • A gamble, he told himself. But I 
will have to gamble. 

For there was no possibility of 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wrenching the ship free by using 
the engines. The tubes, he knew, 
were packed with sand and any at- 
tempt to use the rockets would sim- 
ply mean that he and the ship and 
a good portion of the landscape 
would evaporate in a flashing puff 
of atomic fury. 

He had lifted a ship from a 
Cygnian planet and driven it across 
eleven years of space by the power 
of mind alone. He had rolled two 
sixes. 

Perhaps, he told himself. Per- 
haps . 

There were tons of sand and he 
was deathly tired, tired despite the 
smooth, efficient functioning of his 
non-human system of metabolism. 

I rolled two sixes, he said. Surely 
that was harder than the task I must 
do now. Although that called for 
deftness and this will call for power 
. and suppose, just suppose I 
haven't got the strength. 

For it would take strength to 
lift this buried mass of metal out of 
the mound of sand. Not the 
strength of muscles, but the 
strength of mind. 

Of course, he told himself, if he 
could not lift the ship, he still could 
use the time-mover, shift the ship, 
lying where it was, forward 6,000 
years. Although there were hazards 
he did not like to think about. For 
in shifting the ship through time, 
he would be exposing it to every 
threat and vagary of the river 
through the whole 6,000 years. 

He put his hand up to his throat, 



feeling for the key chain that hung 
around his neck. 

There was no chain! 

Mind dulled by sudden terror, 
he stood frozen for a moment. 

Pockets, he thought, but his 
hands fumbled with a dread cer- 
tainty that there was no hope. For 
he never put the keys of the ship in 
his pockets . always on their 
chain around his neck where they 
would be safe. 

He searched, feverishly at first, 
then with a grim, cold thorough- 
ness. 

His pockets held no keys. 

The chain broke, he thought in 
frantic desperation. The chain 
broke and it fell inside my clothes. 
He patted himself, carefully, from 
head to foot, and it was not there. 
He took off his shirt, gently, cau- 
tiously, feeling for the missing 
keys. He tossed the shirt aside, and 
sitting down, pulled off his trous- 
ers, searching in their folds, turn- 
ing them inside out. 

There were no keys. 

On hands and knees, he searched 
the sands of the river bed, fum- 
bling in the dim light that filtered 
through the rushing water. 

An hour later he gave up. 

The shifting, water-driven sand 
already had closed the trench he 
had dug to the lock, and now there 
was no point of getting to the 
lock, for he could not open it 
when he got there. 

His shirt and trousers had van- 
ished with the current.

Wearily, beaten, he turned to- 
ward the shore, forcing his way 
through the stubborn water. His 
head broke into open air and the 
first stars of evening were shining 
in the east. 

On shore he sat down with his 
back against a tree. He took one 
breath and then another, willed the 
first heartbeat, then the second and 
a third . nursed the human 
metabolism back into action once 
again. 

The river gurgled at him, deep 
laughter on its tongue. In the 
wooded valley a whippoorwill be- 
gan its sadistic suggestion. Fireflies 
danced through the blackness of 
the bushes. 

A mosquito stung him and he 
slapped at it savagely. 

A place to sleep, he thought. A 
hay-loft in a barn, perhaps. And 
pilfered food from a farmer's gar- 
den to fill his empty belly. Then 
clothes. 

At least he knew where he’d get 
the clothes. 

XXXVII 

UNDAYS were lonely. 

During the rest of the 
week there was work — phys- 
ical labor — for a man to do, the 
endless, trudging round of work 
that is necessary to extract a living 
from the soil. Land to plow, crops 
to be put in and tended and 
finally harvested, wood to cbt, 
fences to be built and mended, 



machines to be repaired — things 
that must be done with bone and 
muscle, with calloused hand and 
aching back and the hot Sun on 
one's neck or the whiplash of 
windy cold biting at one’s bones. 

For six days a farmer labored 
and the labor was a thing that 
dulled one to the aching empti- 
ness of memory, and, at night, 
when work was done, sleep was 
swift and merciful. There were 
times when the work, not only for 
its sedative effect, but of its very 
self became a thing of interest and 
of satisfaction. The straight line 
of new-set fence posts became a 
minor triumph when one glanced 
back along their length. The har- 
vest field with its dust upon one’s 
shoes and its smell of Sun on 
golden straw and the clacking of 
the binder as it went its rounds 
became a full-breasted symbolism 
of plenty and contentment. And 
there were moments when the 
pink blush of apple blossoms shin- 
ing through the silver rain of 
spring became, a wild and pagan 
paean of the resurrection of the 
Earth from the frosts of winter. 

For six days a man would labor 
and would not have time to think; 
on the seventh day he rested and 
braced himself for the’ loneliness 
and the thoughts of desperation 
that idleness would bring. 

Not a loneliness for a people 
or a world or a way of life, for 
this world was kindlier and closer 
to Earth and life and safer — muqji

safer — than the world one had 
left behind. But a nagging loneli- 
ness, an accusing loneliness that 
talked of a job that waited; a 
piece of work that now might 
wait forever, a task that must be 
done, but now never might be 
done. 

At first there had been hope. 

Surely, Sutton thought, they will 
look for me. Surely they will find 
a way to reach me. 

The thought was a comfort that 
he hugged close against himself, 
a p£ace of mind that he could not 
bring himself to analyze too close- 
ly. For he realized, even as he 
coddled it, that it was unrealistic, 
that it might not survive too close 
a scrutiny, that it was fashioned of 
faith and of wishful thinking and 
that for all its wealth of comfort 
it might be a fragile bauble. 

T HE past cannot be changed, he 
argued with himself, not in 
its entirety. It can be altered — 
subtly. It can be twisted and it 
can be dented and it can be 
whittled down, but by and large 
it stands. And that is - why I’m 
here and will have to stay until 
old John H. writes the letter to 
himself. For the past is in the 
letter — the letter brought me here 
and it will keep me here until it’s 
finally written. Up to that point 
the pattern must necessarily hold, 
for up to that point in time the 
past, so far as I and my relation 
with it are concerned, is a known 



and a revealed past. But the mo- 
ment the letter is written, it be- 
comes an unknown past; it tends 
to the speculative and there is no 
known pattern. After the letter is 
written, so far as I’m concerned, 
anything can happen. 

Although he admitted, even as 
he thought it, that his premise was 
fallacious. Known or not, revealed 
or unrevealed, the past would 
form a pattern. For the past had 
happened. He was living in a time 
that already had been set and 
molded. 

Even in that thought there was 
a hope, however. Even in the un- 
knownness of the past and the 
knowledge that what had happened 
was a thing that stood unchanged, 
there must be hope. For some- 
where, somewhen he had written 
a book. The book existed and 
therefore had happened, although, 
of course, it had not happened 
yet. But he had seen two copies 
of the book and that meant that 
in some future age the book was 
a factor in the pattern of the past. 

Sometime, said Sutton, they 
will find me. Sometime before it 
is too late. 

They will hunt for me and find 
me. They will have to find me. 

They? he asked himself, finally 
honest with himself. 

Herkimer, an android. 

Eva Armour, a woman. 

They . two people. 

But not those two alone. Sure- 
ly not those two alone. Back of

them, like a shadowy army, all the 
other androids and all the robots 
that Man had ever fashioned. And 
here and there a human who saw 
the rightness of the proposition 
that Man could not, by mere self- 
assertion, be a special being; un- 
derstanding that it was to his 
greater glory to take his place 
among the other things of life, as 
a simple thing of life, as a form of 
life that could lead and teach and 
be a friend, rather than a power- 
hungry creature that conquered 
and ruled and stood as one apart. 

They would look for him, of 
course, but where? 

With all of time and all of 
space to search in, how would 
they know when and where to 
look? 

T HE robot at the information 
center, he remembered, could 
tell them that he had inquired 
about an ancient , town called 
Bridgeport, Wisconsin. And that 
would tell them where. But no one 
could tell them when. 

For no one knew about the 
letter . absolutely no one. He 
remembered how the dried and 
flaky mucilage had showered down 
across his hands in a white and 
aged powder when his thumb 
nail had cracked loose the flap of 
the envelope. No one, certaiply, 
had seen the contents of that 
letter since the day it had been 
written until he, himself, had 
opened it. 



He realized now that he should 
have gotten word to someone . 
word of where and when he was 
going and what he meant to do. 
But he had been so confident and 
it had seemed such a simple thing, 
such a splendid plan. 

A splendid plan in the very 
directness of its action ... to in- 
tercept the Revisionist, to knock 
him out and take his ship and go 
forward into time to take his place. 
•It could have been arranged, of 
that he was certain. There would 
have been an android somewhere 
to help fashion his disguise. There 
would have been papers in the 
ship and androids from the future 
to brief him on the things that he 
would have had to know. 

A splendid plan . except it 
hadn't worked. 

I could have told the informa- 
tion robot, Sutton told himself. 
He certainly was one of us. He 
would have passed the word along. 

He sat with his back against the 
tree and stared out across the river 
valley, hazy with the blue of the 
Indian summer. In the field below 
him the corn stood in brown and 
golden shocks, like a village of 
wigwams that clustered tight and 
warm against the sure knowledge 
of the winter's coming. To the 
west the bluffs of the Mississippi 
were a purple cloud that crouched 
close against the land. To the north 
the golden land swept up in low 
hill rising on low hill until it 
reached a misty point where.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



somewhere, land stopped and sky 
began, although one could not find 
the definite dividing point, no 
clear-cut pencil mark that held the 
two apart. 

A field mouse came out of a 
corn shock and looked at Sutton 
for a moment with its beady eyes, 
then squeaked in sudden fright 
and whisked into the shock again, 
its tail looped above its back in 
frantic alarm. 

Simple folk, thought Sutton. 
The little, simple, furry folk. They 
would be with me, too, if they 
could only know. The bluejay and 
the field mouse, the owl and hawk 
and squirrel. A brotherhood, he 
thought . the brotherhood of 
life. 

H E HEARD the mouse rustling 
in the shock and he tried to 
imagine what life as a mouse might 
mean. Fear first of all, of course, 
the ever-present, quivering, over- 
riding fear of other life, of owl 
and hawk, of mink and fox and 
skunk. And the fear of Man, he 
added. All things fear Man. Man 
has caused all things to fear him. 

Then there would be hunger, or 
at least the dread and threat of 
hunger. And the urge to repro- 
duce. There would be the urgency 
and the happiness of life, the 
thrill of swiftly moving feet and 
the ‘sleek contentment of the well- 
filled belly and the sweetness of 
sleep . and what else? What 
else might fill, a mouse’s life? 



He crouched in a place of safety 
and listened and knew that all was 
well. All was safe and there were 
food and shelter against the com- 
ing cold. For he knew about the 
cold, not so much from the expe- 
rience of other winters as from 
an instinct handed down' through 
many generations of shivering in 
the cold and dying of winter 
famine. 

To his ears came the soft 
rustlings in the corn shock as 
others of his kind moved softly 
on their business. He smelled the 
sweetness of the Sun-cured grass 
that had been brought in to fash- 
ion nests for warm and easy sleep- 
ing. And he smelled, as well, the 
grains of corn and the succulent 
weed seeds that would keep their 
bellies full. 

All is well, he thought. All is 
as it should be. But one must keep 
watch, one must never lower one’s 
guard, for security is a thing that 
can be swept away in a single in- 
stant. And we are so soft ... we 
are so soft and frail, and we make 
good eating. A paw-step in the 
dark can spell swift and sure dis- 
aster. A whir of wings is the song 
of death. 

He closed his eyes and tucked 
his feet beneath him and wrapped 
his tail around him. 

Sutton sat with his back against 
the tree and suddenly, without 
knowing how or when he had be- 
come so, he was rigid with the 
knowledge of what had happened. 



TIME QUARRY 



>JS 



He had closed his eyes and 
tucked his feet beneath him and 
wrapped his tail about him and he 
had known the simple fears and 
the artless, ambitionless content- 
ment of another life ... of a life 
that hid in a corn shock from the 
paw-steps and the wings, that slept 
in Sun-scented grass and felt a 
vague but vital happiness in the 
sure and fundamental knowledge 
of food and warmth and shelter. 

H E HAD not felt it merely, or 
known it alone ... he had 
been the little creature, he had 
been the mouse that the corn shock 
sheltered; and at the one and the 
same time he had been Asher Sut- 
ton, sitting with his back against 
a straight-trunked shellbark hick- 
ory tree, gazing out across the 
autumn-painted valley. 

There were two of us, said 
Sutton. I, myself, and I, the mouse. 
There were two of us at once, each 
with his separate identity. The 
mouse, the real mouse, did not 
know it, for if he had known or 
guessed, I would have known as 
well, for I was as much the mouse 
as I was myself. 

He sat quiet and still, not a 
muscle moving, wonder gnawing 
at -him. Wonder and a fear, a fear 
of a dormant alienness that lay 
within his brain. 

He had brought a ship from 
Cygni, he had returned from death, 
he had rolled a six. 

Now this!

A man is born and he has a 
body and a mind that have many 
functions, some of them complex, 
and it takes him years to learn 
those functions, more years to 
master them. Months before one 
takes a toddling step, months more 
before one shapes a word, years 
before thought and logic become 
polished tools . and sometimes, 
said Sutton, sometimes they never 
do. 

Even then there is a certain 
guidance, the guidance of expe- 
rienced mentors . parents at 
first and teachers after that and 
the doctors and the churches and 
all the men of science and the 
people that one meets. All the peo- 
ple, all the contacts, all the forces 
that operate to shape one into a 
social being capable of using the 
talents that he holds for the good 
of himself and the society which 
guides him and holds him to its 
path. 

Heritage, too, thought Sutton 
. the inbred knowledge and the 
will to do and think certain things 
in a certain way. The tradition of 
what other men have done and 
the precepts that have been fash- 
ioned from the wisdom of the 
ages. 

The normal human has one 
body and one mind, and Lord 
knows, Sutton thought, that is 
enough for any man to get along 
with. But I, to all intent, have 
what amounts to a second body 
and perhaps even a second mind, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but for that second body I have 
no mentors and I have no heritage. 
I do not know how to use it yet; 
I'm just taking my first toddling 
step. 1 am finding out, slowly, one 
by one, the things that I may do. 
Later on, if I live long enough, 
I may even learn to do them well. 

But there are mistakes that one 
will make. A child will stumble 
when it walks at first, and its 
words, to begin with, are only the 
approximation of words, and it 
does not know enough not to burn 
its finger with matches it has 
lighted. 

"Johnny,” he said. “Johnny, 
talk to me.” 

"Yes, Ash?” 

"Is there more, Johnny?” 

"Wait and see,” said Johnny. 
“I cannot tell you. You must wait 
and see.”

T HE android investigator 
said; "We checked Bridge- 
port back to the year 
2,000 and we are convinced noth- 
ing happened there. It was a small 
village and it lay off the main 
trunk of world happenings.” 

"It wouldn’t have to be a big 
thing,” Eva Armour told him. "It 
could have been a little thing. Just 
some slight clue. A word out of 
the context of the future, perhaps. 
A word that Sutton might have 
dropped in some unguarded mo- 
ment and someone else picked up 



and used. Within a few years a 
word like that would become a 
part of the dialect of that com- 
munity.” 

"We checked for the little 
things, miss,” the investigator 
said. "We checked for any change, 
any hint that might point to Sut- 
ton having been in that commun- 
ity. We used approved methods 
and we covered the field. But we 
found nothing, absolutely noth- 
ing. The place is barren of any 
leads at all.” 

"He milst have gone there,” 
said Eva. "The robot at the in- 
formation center talked to him. He 
asked about Bridgeport. It indi- 
cates that he had some interest in 
the place.” 

"But it didn’t necessarily indi- 
cate that he was going there,” 
Herkimer pointed out. 

"He went some place,” said 
Eva. "Where did he go?” 

"We threw in as large a force 
of investigators as was possible 
without arousing suspicion, both 
locally and in the future,” the in- 
vestigator told them. "Our men 
practically fell over one another. 
We sent them out as book sales- 
men and scissor grinders and un- 
employed laborers looking for 
work. We canvassed every home 
for forty miles around, first at 
twenty-year intervals, then, when 
wfeilfound nothing, at ten, and 
filially at five. If there had been 
any word or any rumor, we would 
have run across it.”

"Back to the year 2,000, you 
say?” asked Herkimer. "Why not 
to 1999 or 1950 or even 1800?” 

"We had to set an arbitrary 
date somewhere,” the investigator 
told him. 

"The Sutton family lived in 
that locality,” said Eva. "I suppose 
you investigated them just a bit 
more closely.”' 

"We had men working on the 
Sutton farm off and on,” said the 
investigator. "As often as the 
family was in need of any help 
on the farm, one of our men 
showed up to get himself the job. 
When the family needed no help, 
we had men on other farms near- 
by. One of our men bought a tract 
of timber in that locality and spent 
ten years at woodcutting ... he 
could have stretched it out much 
longer, but we were afraid some- 
one would get suspicious. 

"We did this from the year 
2,000 up to 3150, when the last 
of the family moved from the 
area.” 

E VA looked at Herkimer. "The 
family has been checked all 
the way?” she asked. 

Herkimer nodded. "Right to the 
day that Asher left for Cygni. 
There’s nothing that would help 
us." 

Eva said, "It seems so hopeless. 
He is somewhere. Something hap- 
pened to him. The future, per- 
haps." 

"That’s what I was thinking,” 



Herkimer told her. "The Revi- 
sionists may have intercepted him. 
They may be holding him.” 

“They couldn’t hold him . 
not Asher Sutton,” Eva said. 
"They couldn’t hold him if he 
knew all his powers.” 

"But he doesn’t know them,” 
Herkimer reminded her. "And we 
couldn't tell him about them or 
draw them to his attention. He 
had to find them for himself. He 
had to be put under pressure and 
suddenly discover them by natural 
reaction. He couldn’t be taught 
them; he had to evolve into 
them." 

"We did so well,” said Eva. 
"We seemed to be doing so well. 
We forced Morgan into ill-con- 
sidered action by conditioning 
Benton into challenging Sutton, 
the one quick way to get rid of 
Asher when Adams failed to fall 
in with the plan to kill him. And 
that Benton incident put Asher on 
his guard without our having to 
tell him that he should be careful. 
And now,” she said. "And 
now. 

"The book was written,” Her- 
kimer told her. 

"But it doesn’t have to be,” said 
Eva. "You and I may be no more 
than puppets in some probability 
world that will pinch out tomor- 
row.” 

"We’ll cover all key points in 
the future,” Herkimer promised 
her. "We’ll redouble our espion- 
age of the Revisionists, check back

on every task force of the past. 
Maybe we’ll learn something.” 

"It’s the random factors,” Eva 
said. "You can't be sure, ever. All 
of time and space for them to 
happen in. How can we know 
where to look or turn? Do we 
have to fight our way through 
every possible happening to get 
the thing we want?" 

"You forget one factor,” Herki- 
mer said calmly. 

"One factor?” 

"Yes, Sutton himself. Sutton is 
somewhere and I have great faith 
in him. In him and his destiny. 
For, you see, he listens closely to 
his destiny and that will pay off 
in the end.” 

Eva walked to the window. 

Ash, she thought. Ash, my love, 
you simply have to be all right. 
You must know what you’re do- 
ing. You must come back to us 
and you must write the book 
and. 

Not for me alone, she thought. 
Not for me alone, for I, least of 
all of them, have a claim on you. 
But the galaxy has a claim on you, 
and maybe someday the universe. 
The little striving lives are wait- 
ing for your words and the hope 
and dignity they spell. And most 
of all the dignity. Dignity ahead 
of hope. The dignity of equality 
. the dignity of the knowledge 
that all life is on an equal basis 
. that life is all that matters 
. that life is the badge of a 
greater brotherhood than anything 



the mind of Man has ever spelled 
out in all its theorizing. 

And I, she thought, have no 
right to think the way I do, to feel 
the way I do. 

But I can’t help it, Ash. I can’t 
help but love you. 

Someday, she thought, and knew 
it for a hopeless wish. 

She stood straight and lonely 
and the tears moved slowly down 
her cheeks, and she did not raise 
her hand to brush them off. 

Dreams, she thought. Broken 
dreams are bad enough. But the 
dream that has no hope . the 
dream that it doomed long before 
it’s broken . that’s the worst of 
all.

The two men leaned on the pas- 
ture bars and watched the twink- 
ling of the house and auto lights 
from across the river. In the dark- 
ness on the slope below them, the 
cattle, turned out after milking, 
moved about with quiet, soft 
sounds, cropping a last few mouth- 
fuls of grass before settling down 
to sleep. A breeze with a touch of 
coolness in it drifted up the slope 
and it was fine and soothing after 
a day of heat. 

"We always get a cool night 
breeze,” said old John H. "No 
matter how hot the day may be, 
we have easy sleeping.” 

He sighed. "I wonder some- 
times,” he said, "how well con- 
tented a man should let himself 
become. I wonder if it may not be 
a sign of — well, almost sinfulness. 
For Man is not by nature a con- 
tented animal. He is restless and 
unhappy and it’s that same un- 
happiness that has driven him, like 
a lash across his back, to his great 
accomplishments.” 

"Contentedness,” said Asher 
Sutton, "is an indication of com- 
plete adjustment to one’s particu- 
lar environment. It is a thing that 
is not often found . that is too 
seldom found. Someday Man, and 
other creatures as well, will know 
how to achieve it and there will be 
peace and happiness in all the gal- 
axy.” 

John H. chuckled. "You take 
in a lot of territory, William.” 

"I was taking the long-range 



view,” said Sutton. "Someday Man 
will be going to the stars.” 

John H. nodded. "Yes, I sup- 
pose he will. But he will go too 
soon. Before Man goes to the stars, 
he should learn how to live on 
Earth.” 

He yawned and said: ”1 think 
I will turn in. Getting old, you 
know, and I need my rest.” 

"I’m going to walk around a 
bit,” said Sutton. 

"You do a lot of walking, Wil- 
liam.” 

"After dark,” said Sutton, "the 
land is different than it is in day- 
light. It smells different. Sweet 
and fresh and clean, as if it were 
just washed. You hear things in 
the quietness you do not hear in 
daylight. You walk and you are 
alone with the land and the land 
belongs to you.” 

J OHN H. wagged his head. "It’s 
not the land that’s different, 
William. It is you. Sometimes I 
think you see and hear things that 
the rest of us do not know. Al- 
most, William. .” he hesitated, 
then added abruptly, "almost as if 
you did not quite belong.” 
"Sometimes I think I don’t.” 
"Remember this,” John H. told 
him. "You are one of us . one 
of the family, seems like. Let me 
see, how many years now?” 
"Ten,” said Sutton. 

"That's right. I can usually re- 
call the day you came, but some- 
times I forget. Sometimes it seems 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that you were always here. Some- 
times I catch myself thinking 
you’re a Sutton.” 

He hacked and cleared his 
throat, spitting in the dust. "I 
borrowed your typewriter the 
other day, William. I had a letter 
I had to write. It was an impor- 
tant letter and I wanted it done 
properly.” 

"It’s all right,” said Sutton. "I’m 
glad it was some use to you.” 
"Getting any writing done these 
days, William?” 

“No,” said Sutton, "I gave up. 
I couldn’t do it. I lost my notes, 
you see. I had it all figured out. 
and I had it down on paper, and 
I thought maybe I could remem- 
ber it, but I found I couldn’t. It’s 
no use trying.” 

John H.’s voice was a soft, low 
sound in the darkness. "You in 
any kind of trouble, William?” 
"No,” said Sutton. "Not exactly 
trouble." 

"Anything I can do to help?” 
"Not a thing,” said Sutton. 

"Let me know if there is,” in- 
sisted the old man. "We’d do any- 
thing for you.” 

"Someday I may go away,” said 
Sutton. "Maybe suddenly. If I do, 
I wish you would forget me, for- 
get I was ever here.” 

"That’s What you wish, lad?” 
"Yes, it is,” said Sutton. 

"We can’t forget you, William. 
We never could do that. But we 
won’t talk about you. If someone 
comes and asks about you, we’ll 



act as if you never had been here.” 
He paused. "Is that the way you 
want it, William?” 

"Yes,” said Sutton. "If you 
don’t mind, that’s the way I want 
it.” 

They stood silent for a moment, 
facing one another in the dark. 
Then the old man turned around 
and clumped toward the lighted 
windows of the house and Sutton, 
turning, too, leaned his arms on 
the pasture bars and stared across 
the river where the faery lights 
were blinking in a land of never- 
never. 

T EN years, thought Sutton, and 
the letter’s written. Ten years 
and the conditions of the past are 
met. Now the past can get along 
without me, for I was only stay- 
ing so that John H. could write 
the letter ... so that he could 
write it and I could find it in an 
old trunk 6,000 years from now 
and read it on a nameless asteroid 
I won by killing a man in a place 
of synthetic dreams that will be 
called the Zag House. 

The Zag House will be over 
there across the river, he thought, 
far up the plain above the ancient 
town of Prairie du Chien; and the 
University of North America, with 
its towers of beauty, will be set 
on the hills there to the north, 
and Adams’ house will be near the 
confluence of the Wisconsin and 
Mississippi Rivers. Great ships will 
climb into the sky from the Iowa

prairies and head out for the stars 
that even now are twinkling over- 
head . and other stars that no 
man’s eye can see unaided. 

Far across the river, he thought, 
that's where the Zag House will 
be. And that is where someday, 
6,000 years from now, I will meet 
a little girl in a checkered apron. 
Like in a story, he thought. Boy 
meets girl and the boy is tow- 
headed with a cowlick and he’s 
barefooted and the .girl twists her 
apron in her little hands and tells 
him what her name is. 

He. straightened and gripped the 
top bar of the pasture gate. 

"Eva," he said hopelessly, 
"where are you?” 

Her hair was copper and her 
eyes . what color were her eyes? 
I have studied you for twenty 
years, she had said, and he had 
wanted to kiss her for it, not be- 
lieving the words she spoke, but 
ready to believe the unspoken 
word of her proud face and lovely 
body. 

Somewhere she still -existed, 
somewhere in time and space. 
Somewhere she might be thinking 
of him as even now he thought of 
her. If he tried hard enough, he 
might contact her. Might drive his 
hunger for her through the folds 
of space and time and let her 
know that he still remembered, 
still wanted her, that somehow, 
sometime he would come back to 
her. 

But even as he thought of it, he 



knew that it was unreal, that he 
floundered in the grasp of forgot- 
ten time as a man may flounder in 
a running sea. It was not he who 
would reach out for her, for he 
could not, but she or Herkimer or 
someone else might reach out to 
him ... if anyone ever did. 

Ten years, he thought, and they 
seem to -have forgotten me. Is it 
because they cannot find me, or, 
having found me, cannot reach 
me? Or is it for a purpose, and if 
that is it, what can the purpose be? 

There had been times when he 
had felt that he was being 
watched, that nasty touch of cold 
between the shoulder blades. And 
there had been the time when 
someone had run from him when 
he had been in the woods, late of 
a summer evening, hunting for the 
fence- jumping, cross-eyed heifer 
that was forever getting lost. 

He turned from the pasture bars 
and through the barnyard, making 
his way in the darkness as a man 
will walk in a well- remembered 
room. From the barn came the 
scent of freshly mown hay, and in 
the row of chicken coops one of 
the young birds was cheeping 
sleepily. 

E VEN as he walked, his mind 
flicked out and touched the 
disturbed chicken’s mind. 

Fluttering dread of an unknown 
thing . there had been a sound 
coming on the edge of sleep. And 
a sound was danger ... a signal of 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an unknown danger. Sound and 
nowhere to go. Darkness and 
sound. Apprehension. 

Sutton pulled back his mind 
and walked on. Not much stability 
in a chicken, he thought. A cow 
was contented and its thought and 
purpose as slow-moving as its feed- 
ing. A dog was alive and friendly, 
and a cat, no matter how well 
tamed it might be, still walked the 
jungle’s edge. 

I know them all, he thought. I 
have been each one of them. And 
there are some that are not quite 
pleasant. A rat, for example, or a 
weasel or a bass lying in wait be- 
neath the lily pads. But the skunk 
. the skunk was a pleasant fel- 
low. One could enjoy living as a . 
skunk. 

Curiosity or practice? Perhaps 
curiosity, he admitted, the human 
penchant for prying into things 
that were hung with signs: No 
Trespassing. Keep Out. Private. 
Do Not Disturb. But practice as 
well, learning one of the tools of 
the second body. Learning how to 
move into another mind and share 
its every shade of intellectual and 
emotional reactions. 

But there was a line ... a line 
he had never crossed, either 
through innate decency or a fear 
of being found out. He could not 
decide quite which. 

The road was a dusty strip of 
white that ran along the ridge, 
twisting between the deep bowls 
of darkness where the land fell 



away into deep hollows. Sutton 
walked slowly, footfalls muffled by 
the dust. The land was black and 
the road was white and the stars 
were large and soft in the summer 
night. So different, Sutton thought, 
from the winter stars. In the win- 
ter the stars retreated high into the 
sky and glowed with a hard and 
steely light. 

Peace and quiet, he told himself. 
In this corner of the ancient Earth 
there is peace and quiet, unbroken 
by the turbulence of twentieth cen- 
tury living. 

From a land like this came the 
steady men, the men who in a few 
more generations would ride the 
ships out to the stars. Here, in the 
quiet corners of the world, were 
built the stamina and courage, the 
depth of character and the deep 
convictions that would take the en- 
gines that more brilliant, less stable 
men had dreamed, and drive them 
to the farthest rims of the galaxy, 
there to hold key. worlds for the 
glory and the profit of the race. 

The profit, Sutton said. The 
glory gets dimmed by profit some- 
how. 

Ten years, he thought, and the 
involuntary compact with time has 
been consummated . each condi- 
tion filled. I am free to go. 

But there was no place to go and 
no way to get there. 

I would like to stay, said Sutton. 
It is pleasant here. 

"Johnny,” he said. "Johnny, 
what are we going to do?” 



TIME QUARRY

H E FELT the stir in his mind, 
the old canine stir, the wag- 
ging tail, the comfort of blankets 
tucked about a child in his bed. 

"It’s all right, Ash," said 
Johnny. "Everything’s all right. 
You needed these ten years.” 
"You’ve stayed with me, 
Johnny.” 

"I am you,” said Johnny. "I 
came when you were born, I'll stay 
until you die.” 

"And then?” 

"You’ll - not need me. Ash. I’ll 
go to something or someone else. 
None walks ' alone.” 

• None walks alone, said Sutton, 
and he said it like a prayer. 

And he was not alone. 

Someone walked beside him, and 
where he’d come from, and how 
long he’d been there, Sutton did 
not know. 

"This, is a splendid walk,” said 
the man, whose face was hidden in 
darkness. "Do you take it often?” 
"Almost every night,” said Sut- 
ton’s tongue, and his brain warned: 
Steady! Steady! 

"It’s so quiet,” said the man. 
"So quiet and alone. It is good for 
thinking. A man could do a lot of 
thinking, walking nights out here.” 
Sutton did not answer. 

They plodded along, side by 
side, and even while ; he fought to 
keep relaxed, Sutton felt his body 
tensing. 

"You’ve been doing a lot of 
thinking, Sutton,” said the man. 
"Ten whole years of thinking.”' 

124 



"You should know,” said Sut- 
ton. "You’ve been watching me.” 
"We’ve watched,” admitted the 
man. "And our machines have 
watched. We got you down on 
tape and we know a lot about you. 
A whole lot more than we did ten 
years ago.” 

"Ten years ago,” said Sutton, 
*’you sent two men to buy me off.” 
"I know," replied the man. “We 
have often wondered what became 
of them.” 

"That’s an easy one,” Sutton 
said. ”1 killed them.” 

"They had a proposition,” 

"If you can call it that. They 
offered me a planet.” 

"I knew at the time it wouldn’t 
work,” the man declared. "I told 
Trevor that it wouldn’t work.” 

"I suppose you have another 
proposition?” Sutton asked. "A 
slightly higher price?” 

“Not exactly,” said the man. 
"We thought this time we’d cut 
out the bargaining and just let you 
name your price.” 

"I’ll think about it,” Sutton told 
him. "I’m not too sure I can think 
up a price.” 

"As you wish, Sutton," said the 
man. "We’ll be waiting . and 
watching. Just give us the sign 
when you’ve made up your mind.” 
"A sign?” 

"Sure. Just write us a note. 
We’ll be looking over your shoul- 
der. Or just say . ’Well, I’ve 
made up my mind.’ We’ll be lis- 
tening and we'll hear.” 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Simple,” Sutton replied. 
"Nothing to it.” 

"We make it easy for you,” said 
the man. "Good evening, Mr. Sut- 
ton." 

Sutton did not see him do it, but 
sensed that he had touched his hat 
. if he wore a hat. Then he was 
gone, turning off the road and 
going down across the pasture, 
walking in the dark, heading for 
the woods that sloped to the river 
bluffs. 

S UTTON stood in the dusty 
road and listened to him go — 
the soft swish of dew-laden grass 
brushing on his shoes, the muted 
pad of his feet in the pasture. 

Contact at last! After ten years, 
contact with the people from an- 
other time. But the wrong people. 
Not his people. 

The Revisionists had been watch- 
ing him, even as he had sensed 
them watching. Watching and 
waiting, waiting for ten years. But, 
of course, not ten years of their 
time, just ten years of his. Ma- 
chines and watchers would have 
been sprinkled through those ten 
years, so that the job could have 
been done in a year or a month, or 
even in a week, if they had wanted 
to throw enough men and mate- 
rials into the effort. 

But why wait ten years? To 
soften him up, to make him ready 
to jump at anything they offered? 

To soften him up? He grinned 
wryly in the dark. 



Then suddenly the picture came 
to him and he stood there stupidly, 
wondering why he hadn't thought 
of it much sooner. 

They hadn't waited to soften 
him up . they had waited for 
old John H. to write the letter. 
For they knew about the letter. 
They had studied old John H. and 
they knew he’d write a letter. They 
had him down on tape and they 
knew him inside out and they had 
figured to an eyelash the way his 
mind would work. 

The letter was the key to the 
whole thing. The letter was the 
lure that had been used to suck 
Asher Sutton back into this time. 
They had lured him, then sealed 
him off and kept him, kept him as 
surely as if they’d had him in a 
cage. They had studied him and 
they knew him and they had him 
figured out. They knew what he 
would do as surely as they had 
known what old John H. would 
do. 

His mind flicked out and probed 
cautiously at the brain of the man 
striding down the hill. 

Chickens and cats and dogs and 
meadow mice — and not one of 
them suspected, not one of them 
had known that another mind than 
theirs had occupied their brain. 

But the brain of a man might be 
a different matter. Highly trained 
and sensitive, it might detect; out- 
side interference, might sense, if it 
did not actually know, the invasion 
of itself.

The girl won’t wait. I’ve been 
aivay too long. Her affections are 
less than skin deep and she has no 
morals, absolutely none, and I’m 
the one to know. I’ve been on this 
damn patrol too long. She will be 
tired of waiting . she was tired 
of waiting when I was gone three 
hours. To hell with her ... I can 
get another one. But not like her 
. not exactly like her. There 
isn’t another one anywhere quite 
like her. 

Whoever said this Sutton guy 
would be an easy one to crack was 
crazy as a loon. God, after ten 
years in a dump like this, I’d fall 
on someone’s neck and kiss ’em if 
they came back from my own time. 
Anyone at all .. friend or foe, it 
would make no difference. Bin 
what does Sutton do? Not a damn 
word. N.ot a single syllable of sur- 
prise in any word he spoke. When 
l first spoke to him, he didn’t even 
break his stride, kept right on 
walking as if he knew I’d been 
there all the time. Cripes, l could 
use a drink. Nerve-wracking work. 

Wish l could forget that girl. 
Wish she would be waiting for 
me, but 1 know she won’t. W ish 

S UTTON snapped back his 
mind, stood quietly in the 
road. 

And inside himself he felt the 
shiver of triumph, the swift back- 
wash of relief and triumph. They 
didn’t know. In all their ten years 
of watching, they had seen no more 



than the superficial things.. They 
had him down on tape, but they 
didn’t know all that went on with- 
in his mind. 

A human mind, perhaps. But 
not his mind. A human mind they 
might be able to strip as bare as a 
sickled field, might dissect it and 
analyze it and read the story in it. 
But his mind told them only what 
it wished to tell them, only enough 
so that there would.be no suspicion 
that he was holding back. Ten 
years ago Adams’ gang had tried 
to tap his mind and had not even 
dented it. 

The Revisionists had watched 
ten years and they knew each mo- 
tion that he made, many of the 
things that he had thought. 

But they did not know that he 
could go to live within the mind 
of a mouse or a catfish or a man. 

For if they had known, they 
would have set up certain safe- 
guards, would have been on the 
alert against him. 

And they weren’t. No more 
alert than the mouse had been. 

He glanced back the road to 
where the Sutton farmhouse stood 
upon the hill. For a moment he 
thought that he could see it, a 
darker mass against the darkness of 
the sky, but that, he knew, was no 
more than pure imagination. He 
knew it was there and he had 
formed a mental image. 

One by one, he checked the 
items in his room. The books, the 
few scribbled papers, the razor.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There was nothing there, he 
knew, that he could not leave be- 
hind. Not a thing that would 
arouse suspicion. Nothing that 
could be fastened on in some later 
day and turned into a weapon to 
be used against him. 

He had been prepared against 
this day, knowing that some day it 
would come — that some day Her- 
kimer or the Revisionists oi; an 
agent from the government would 
step from behind a tree and walk 
along beside him. 

Knowing? Well, not exactly. 
Hoping. And ready for the hope. 

Long years ago his futile attempt 
to write the book of destiny with- 
out his notes had gone up in 
smoke. All that remained was a 
heap of paper ash, mixed these 
many years with the soil. Bleached 
away by the rains, gone as chemical 
elements into a head of wheat or 
an ear of corn. 

He was ready. Packed and 
ready. His mind had been packed 
and ready, he knew now, for these 
many years. 

Softly he stepped off the road 
and went down across the pasture, 
following the man who walked to- 
ward the river bluffs. His mind 
flicked out and tracked him through 
the darkness, using his thoughts to 
track him as a h6und would use 
his nose to track a fox. 

H E OVERHAULED him scant 
minutes after he had entered 
the fringe of trees and after that 



kept a few paces behind him, walk- 
ing carefully to guard against the 
suddenly snapping twig, the swish 
of swaying bushes that could have 
warned his quarry. 

The ship lay within a deep ra- 
vine and at a hail it lighted up and 
a port swung open. Another man 
stood in the port and stared into 
the night. 

"That you, Gus?”, he called. 

The other swore at 'him. "Who 
else do you think would be floun- 
dering around in these woods at 
the dead of night?” 

"I got to worrying,” said the 
man in the port. "You were gone 
longer than I thought you would 
be. Just getting ready to set out 
and hunt for you.” 

"You’re always worrying,” Gus 
growled at him. "Between you and 
this outlandish ancient world, I’m 
fed up. Trevor can find someone 
else to do this kind of work from 
here on out.” 

He scrambled up the steps into 
the ship. "Get going,” he told the 
other man tersely. "We’re getting 
out of here.” 

He turned to shut the port, but 
Sutton already 'had it closed. 

Gus took two steps backward, 
brought up against an anchored 
chair and stood there, grinning. 

"Look at what we got,” he said. 
"Hey,. Pinky, look at what fol- 
lowed me back home.” 

Sutton smiled at them grimly. 
"If you gentlemen have no objec- 
tion, I’ll hitch a ride with you.”

"And if we have objections?" 
Pinky asked. 

"I'm riding this ship,” Sutton 
told him. "With you or without 
you. Take your choice.” 

"This is Sutton,” Gus told 
Pinky. "The Mr. Sutton. Trevor 
will be glad to see you, Sutton.” 
Trevor . Trevor. That was 
three times he had heard the name, 
and somewhere else he had heard 
it once before. He stood with his 
back against the closed port and 
his mind returned to another ship 
and another two men. 

"Trevor,” Case had said, or had 
it been Pringle who had said it? 
"Trevor? Why, Trevor is the head 
of the corporation.” 

"I’ve been looking forward, all 
these years,” Sutton told them, "to 
meeting Mr. Trevor. He and I will 
have a lot to talk about.” 

"Get her going, Pinky,” Gus 
said. "And send ahead a message. 
Trevor will want to break out the 
guard of honor for us. We're 
bringing Asher Sutton back.”

T REVOR picked up a paper 
clip and flipped it at an ink 
well on the desk. The clip 
landed in the ink. 

"Getting pretty good,” said 
Trevor: "Hit it seven times out of 
every ten. Used to be I missed it 
seven times out of every ten.” 

He looked at Sutton, studying 
him. 



"You look like an ordinary 
man,” be said. "I should be able to 
talk with you and make you under- 
stand.” 

"I haven’t any horns," said Sut- 
ton, “if that is what you mean." 

"Nor,” said Trevor, "any halo, 
either, so far as I’m concerned." 

He flipped another paper clip 
and it missed the ink well. 

"Seven out of ten,” said Trevor. 

He flipped another one. 

"Sutton," said Trevor, "you 
know a great deal about destiny. 
Have you ever thought of it in 
terms of manifest destiny?” 

Sutton shrugged. "You’re using 
an antiquated term. Pure and sim- 
ple propaganda of the nineteenth 
century. There was a certain nation 
that wore that one threadbare.” 

"Propaganda?” Trevor repeated. 
"Let’s call it psychology. You say 
a thing so often and so well that 
after a time everyone believes it. 
Even, finally, yourself.” 

"This manifest destiny,” said 
Sutton. "For the human race, I 
presume?” 

"Naturally,” said Trevor. "After 
all, we’re the animals that would 
know how to use it to the best 
advantage.” 

"You pass up a point,” declared 
Sutton. "The humans don’t need 
it. They already think they are 
great and right and holy. Certainly 
you don’t need to propagandize 
them.” 

"In the short view, you are 
right,” agreed Trevor. "But in the 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



short view only.” He stabbed a 
sudden finger at Sutton. "Once we 
have the galaxy in hand, what do 
we do then ?” 

"Why,” said Sutton and stopped. 
"Why, I suppose . 

"That's exactly it,” said Trevor. 
"You don't know where you’re 
going. Nor does the human race." 

"And manifest destiny?" asked 
Sutton. "If we had manifest des- 
tiny, it would be different?” 

Trevor’s words were scarcely 
more than a whisper. "There are 
other galaxies, Sutton. Greater 
even than this one. Many other 
galaxies.” 

Good Lord! thought Sutton. 

He started to speak and then 
closed his mouth and sat stiffly in 
his chair. 

Trevor's whisper speared at him 
from across the desk. 

"Staggers you, doesn’t it?” he 
demanded. 

Sutton tried to speak aloud, but 
his voice came out a whisper, too. 

"You're mad, Trevor. Absolute- 
ly mad.” 

"The long-range view,” said 
Trevor. "That is what we need. 
The absolutely unshakable belief 
in human destiny, the positive and 
all-inclusive conviction that Man 
is meant not only to take over this 
galaxy alone, but all the galaxies, 
the entire universe.” 

K'W’OU should live long 

-L enough,” said Sutton, sud- 
den mockery rising to his tongue. 



"I won’t see it, of course,” ad- 
mitted Trevor. "And neither will 
you. Nor will our children’s chil- 
dren or their children for many 
generations.” 

"It will take a million years,” 
Sutton told him. 

"More than a million years,” 
Trevor answered calmly. "You 
have no idea, no conception of the 
scope of the universe. In a million 
years we’ll just be getting a good 
start. .” 

"Then, why, ifor the love of 
■heaven, do you and I sit here and 
quibble about it?” 

"Logic,” said Trevor. 

"There is no real logic,” Sutton 
declared, "in planning a million 
years ahead. A man can plan his 
own lifetime, if he wishes, and 
there is -some logic in that. Or the 
life of his children and there still 
would be some logic in it . and 
maybe in the life of his grand- 
children. But beyond that there can 
be no logic." 

"Sutton,” asked Trevor, "did 
you ever hear of a corporation?" 
"Why, yes, of course, but...” 
"A corporation could plan for a 
million years,” said Trevor. "It 
could plan very logically.” 

"A corporation is not a man,” 
said Sutton. "It is not an entity.’ 1 
"But it is,” insisted Trevor. "An 
en f ity composed of men and created 
by men to carry out their wishes. It 
is a living, operative concept that 
is handed down from one genera- 
tion to another to carry out a plan 



TIME 9UARRY

too vast to 'be accomplished in the 
lifetime of one man alone.” 

"Your corporation publishes 
books, too, doesn’t it?” asked Sut- 
ton. 

Trevor stared at him. “Who told 
you that?” he snapped. 

“A couple of men by the name 
of Case and Pringle. They tried to 
buy my book for your, corpora- 
tion.” 

“Case and Pringle are out on a 
mission,” Trevor said. "I had ex- 
pected them back . .” 

“They won’t be coming back.” 

“You killed them,” Trevor said, 
flatly. 

“They tried to kill me first. I’m 
awfully hard to kill.” 

"That would have been against 
my orders, Sutton. I do not want 
you killed.” 

“They were on their own,” said 
Sutton. “They were going to sell 
my carcass to Morgan.” 

There was no way of telling, 
Sutton thought, how you hit this 
man. There was no difference of 
expression in his eyes, no faintest 
flicker of change across his face. 

"I appreciate your killing 
them,” said Trevor. “It saves me 
the bother.” 

He flicked a clip at the ink well 
and it was a hit. 

“It’s logical,” he continued, as 
though Sutton had not spoken, 
"that a corporation should plan a 
million years ahead. It provides a 
framework within which a certain 
project may be carried forward 



without interruption, although the 
personnel in charge should change 
from time to time.” 

“Wait a minute,” Sutton told 
him. “Is there a corporation or are 
you just posing fables?" 

“imHERE is a corporation,” 
JL Trevor told him, “and I am 
the man who heads it. Varied in- 
terests pooling their resources . 
and there will be more and more 
of them as time goes on. As soon 
as we can show something tangi- 
ble.” 

“By tangible, you mean destiny 
for the human race, for the human 
race alone?” 

Trevor nodded. “Then we’ll 
have something to talk about. A 
commodity to sell. Something to 
back up our sales talk.” 

Sutton shook his head. “I can’t 
see what you expect to gain.” 
“Three things,” Trevor told 
'him. “Wealth and power and 
knowledge. The wealth and power 
and knowledge of the universe. 
For Man alone, you understand. 
For a single race. For people like 
you and me. And of the three 
items, knowledge perhaps would 
be the greatest prize of all, for 
knowledge, added to and com- 
pounded, correlated and coordi- 
nated, would lead to even greater 
wealth and power . and to 
greater knowledge.” 

“It is madness,” said Sutton. 
“You and I, Trevor, will be drift- 
ing dust, and not only ourselves, 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but the very era in which we live 
out this moment will be forgotten 
before the job is done.” 

"Remember the corporation.” 
"I'm remembering the corpora- 
tion,” Sutton said, "but I can't 
help but think in terms of people. 
You and I and the other people 
like us.” 

"Let’s think in terms of people, 
then,” said Trevor, smoothly. 
"One day the life that runs in you 
will run in the brain and blood 
and muscle of a man who shall be 
part owner of the universe. There 
will be trillions upon trillions of 
life-forms to serve him, there will 
be wealth that he cannot count, 
there will be knowledge of which 
you and I cannot even dream.” 
Sutton sat quietly, taut in his 
chair. 

"You’re the only man,” said 
Trevor, "who is standing in the 
way. You’re the man who is block- 
ing the project for a million years.” 
"You need destiny,” said Sutton, 
"and destiny is not mine to give 
away.” 

"You are a human being, Sut- 
ton,” Trevor told him, talking 
evenly. "You are a man. It is the 
people of your own race that I’m 
talking to you about.” 

"Destiny,” said Sutton, "be- 
longs to everything that lives. Not 
to Man alone, but to every form of 
life.” 

"It needn’t,” Trevor contra- 
dicted, "You are the only man 
who knows. You are the man who 



can tell the facts. You can make 
it a manifest destiny for the human 
race instead of a personal destiny 
for every crawling, cackling, sniv- 
eling thing that has the gift of 
life.” 

Sutton didn’t answer. 

"One word from you,” said 
Trevor, "and the .thing is done.” 

"It can’t be done,” said Sutton. 
"This scheme of yours — think of 
the sheer time, the thousands of 
years, even at the rate of speed of 
the star-ships of today, to cross in- 
tergalactic space. Only from this 
galaxy to the next . not from 
this to the outermost galaxy.” 

T REVOR sighed. "You forget 
what I said about the com- 
pounding of knowledge. Two and 
two won’t make four, my friend. It 
will make much more than four. In 
some instances thousands of times 
more than four.” 

Sutton shook his head, wearily. 
But Trevor was right, he knew. 
Knowledge and technique would 
pyramid exactly as he said. Even, 
once Man had the time to do it, 
the knowledge in a single galaxy 
alone ... * 

"One word from you,” said 
Trevor, "and the war is at an end. 
One word and the security of the 
human race is guaranteed forever. 
For all the race will need is the 
knowledge that you can give.it.” 
"It wouldn’t be the truth.” 
"That,” replied Trevor, "doesn't 
have a thing to do with it.”

"You don't need manifest des- 
tiny," said Sutton, "to carry out 
your project.” 

"We have to have the human 
race behind us. We have to have 
something that is big enough to 
capture their imagination. Some- 
thing important enough to make 
them pay attention. And manifest 
destiny — manifest destiny as it ap- 
plies to the universe — is the thing 
to turn the trick." 

"Thirty years ago," said Sutton, 
"I might have thrown in with 
you.” 

"And now?” asked Trevor. 

Sutton shook his head. "Not 
now. I know more than I did 
thirty years ago. Thirty years ago 
I was a human, Trevor. I'm not too 
sure I’m entirely human any 
longer.” 

"I hadn’t mentioned the matter 
of reward,” said Trevor. "That 
goes without saying.” 

"No, thanks," said Sutton. "I'd 
like to keep on living.” 

Trevor flipped a clip at the ink 
well and it missed. 

"You’re slipping," Sutton said. 
"Your percentage is way off.” 

Trevor picked up another clip. 

"All right," he said. '.'Go ahead 
and have your fun. There’s a war 
on and we'll win that war. It’s a 
hellish way to fight, 'but we’re 
doing it the best we can. No war 
anywhere, no surface indication of 
war, for you understand the galaxy 
is in utter and absolute peace un- 
der the rule of benevolent Earth- 



men. We can win without you, 
Sutton, but it would be easier with 
you.” 

"You’re going to turn me 
loose?” Sutton asked. 

"Why, sure,” Trevor told him. 
"Go on out and beat your head 
against a stone wall a. little longer. 
In the end, you’ll get tired of it. 
Eventually you’ll give up out of 
sheer exhaustion. You’ll come 
back then and give us the thing we 
want.” 

Sutton rose to his feet. 

He stood for a moment, inde- 
cisive. 

"What are you waiting for?" 
asked Trevor. 

"One thing has me puzzled," 
Sutton answered. "The book, 
somehow, somewhere, already has 
been written. It has been a fact for 
almost five hundred years. How 
are you going to change that? If 
I write it now the way you want it 
written, it will change the human 
setup . .” 

Trevor laughed. "We got that 
one all figured out. Let us say that 
finally, after all of these years, the 
original of your manuscript is dis- 
covered. It can be readily and in- 
disputably identified by certain 
characteristics which you will very 
carefully incorporate into it when 
you write it. It will be found and 
proclaimed, and what is more, 
proven . and the human race 
will have its destiny. 

"We’ll explain the past unpleas- 
antness by very convincing histori-

cal evidence of earlier tampering 
with the manuscript. Even your 
friends, the androids, will have to 
believe what we say, once we get 
through with it.” 

"Clever,” Sutton admitted. 

"I think so, too,” said Trevor. 
"Too bad you won’t have a 
chance to try it,” Sutton said. 

XLI 

A T THE building’s entrance 
a man was waiting for him. 
He raised his hand in what 
might have been a brief salute. 
"Just a minute, (Mr. Sutton.” 
"Yes, what is it?” 

"There’ll be a few of us follow- 
ing you, sir. Orders, you know.” 
"But. .” 

"Nothing personal, sir. We 
won’t interfere with anything you 
want to do. Just guarding you, 
sir.” 

"Guarding me?” 

"Certainly, sir. Morgan’s crowd, 
you know. Can’t let them kill you 
off.” 

"You can’t know,” Sutton told 
him, "how deeply I appreciate your 
interest.” 

"It’s nothing, sir,” the man told 
him. "Just part of the day’s work. 
Glad to do it. Don’t mention it at 
all.” 

iHe stepped back again and Sut- 
ton wheeled and walked down the 
steps and followed the cinder walk 
that flanked the avenue. 

The Sun was near to setting. 



Looking back over his shoulder, 
he saw the tall, straight lines of 
the gigantic office building in 
which he had talked to Trevor out- 
lined against the brightness of the 
western sky. But of anyone who 
might be following him he did not 
see a sign. 

He 'had no place to go. He had 
no idea where to go. But he real- 
ized that he couldn’t stand around 
feeling lost. He'd walk, he told 
himself, and think, and wait for 
whatever was going to happen 
next to happen. 

He met other walkers and a few 
of them stared at him curiously and 
now, for the first time, Sutton real- 
ized that he still wore the clothing 
of a twentieth-century farm hand 
. blue denim overalls and cot- 
ton shirt, with heavy, serviceable 
farm shoes on his feet. 

But here, he knew, even such 
an outlandish costume would not 
arouse undue suspicion. For on 
Earth, with its visiting dignitaries 
from far solar systems, with its 
Babel of races employed in the 
different governmental depart- 
ments, with its exchange students, 
its diplomats and legislators rep- 
resenting backwoods planets, how 
a man dressed would arouse but 
slight curiosity. 

By morning, he told himself, 
he’d have to find some hiding 
place, some retreat where he could 
relax and figure out some of the 
angles in this world of five hun- 
dred years ahead.

Either that or locate an android 
he could trust to put him in touch 
with the android organization . 
for although he had never been 
told so, he had no doubt there was 
an android organization. There 
would have to be to fight a war 
in time. 

H E TURNED off the path that 
flanked the roadway and took 
another one, a faint footpath that 
led out across marshy land toward 
a range of low hills. 

Suddenly now he realized that 
he was hungry and that he should 
have dropped into one of the 
shops in the office building for a 
bite of food. And then he remem- 
bered that he had no money with 
which to pay for food. A few 
twentieth-century dollars were in 
his pockets, but they would be 
worthless here as a medium of ex- 
change, although quite possibly 
they might be collectors’ items. 



Short houra ago, he thought, 
he had walked a dusty ‘hilltop road 
in the twentieth century, scuffing 
the white dust with his shoes . 
and some of the white dust, he 
saw, still clung to the leather. 
Even as the memory of that hilltop 
road still clung to his memory. 
Memory and dust, he thought, 
link us to the past. 

He reached the hills and began 
to climb them and the night was 
sweet with the smell of pine. 

He came to the top of a slight 
rise and stood there for a moment, 
looking out across the velvety soft- 
ness of the night. Somewhere, near 
at hand, a cricket was tentatively 
tuning up his fiddle, and from the 
marsh came the muted sound of 
frogs. In the darkness just ahead 
of him, a stream was splashing 
along its rocky bed and it talked 
as it went along, talked to the 
trees and its grassy banks and the 
nodding flowers above them.

"I would like to stop,” it said. 
”1 would like to stop and talk with 
ygu. But I can’t, you see. I must 
hurry on. I have some place I 
must go. I can’t waste a minute. I 
must hurry on.” 

Like Man, thought Sutton. For 
Man is driven like the stream. Man 
is driven by circumstance and 
necessity and the bright-eyed am- 



never reached its mark. A charg- 
ing body slammed into his knees 
and drove them inward under him. 
Arms wrapped themselves around 
his legs and he staggered, falling 
on his face. 

He sat up and somewhere off 
to the right he heard the soft 
snickering of rapidly firing guns 
and caught, out of the tail of his 




bition of other restless men who 
will not let them be. 

He did not hear a sound, but 
he felt the great hand close upon 
his arm and yank him off the path. 
Twisting, he sought to free him- 
self of the grasp, and saw the dark 
blur of the man who had grabbed 
him. He balled his fist and swung 
it and it was a sledge-hammer 
slamming at the dark head, but it 



eyes, their bright flicker in the 
night. 

Then a hand came out of no- 
where and cupped itself around 
his mouth and nose. 

"Sleeping powder!” he thought. 
"Must hold my breath . 

And even as he thought it, the 
dark figures in the woods, the 
cheeping frogs and the snarling of 
the guns fused into silence.

S UTTON opened his eyes to 
strangeness and lay quietly 
on the bed. A breeze came 
through an open window and the 
room, decorated with fantastic 
life-murals, was splashed with 
brilliant sunlight. The breeze 
brought in the scent of blooming 
flowers and in a tree outside a 
bird was chirping contentedly. 

Slowly Sutton let his senses 
reach out and gather in the facts 
of the room, the facts of strange- 
ness . the unfamiliar furniture, 
the contour of the room itself, the 
green and purple monkeys that 
chased one another along the wavy 
vine that ran around the border of 
the walls. 

Quietly his mind moved back 
along the track of time to his final 
conscious moment. There had been 
guns flickering in the night and 
there had been a hand that reached 
out and cupped his nose. 

Drugged, Sutton told himself. 
Drugged and dragged away. 

Before that there had been a 
cricket and the frogs singing in 
the marsh and the talking brook 
that babbled down the hill, hurry- 
ing to get wherever it was going. 

And before that a man had sat 
across a desk from him and told 
him about a corporation and a 
dream and a plan the corporation 
held. 

Fantastic, Sutton thought. And 
in the bright light of the room. 



the very idea was one of utter 
fantasy . that Man should go 
out, not only to the stars, but to 
the other galaxies, and plan a 
million years ahead. 

But there was greatness in it, a 
very human greatness. There had 
been a time when it had been fan- 
tasy to think that Man could ever 
lift himself from the bosom of 
the planet of his birth. And an- 
other time when it had been fan- 
tasy to think that Man would go 
beyond the solar system, out into 
the dread reaches of nothingness 
that stretched between the stars. 
And through time itself. , 

But there had been strength in 
Trevor, and conviction as well as 
strength. A man who knew where 
he was going and why he was go- 
ing and what it took to get there. 

Manifest destiny, Trevor had 
said. That is what it takes. That 
is what it needs. 

Man would be almost a god. 
The concepts of life and thought 
that had been bom on the Earth 
would be the basic concepts of the 
entire universe, of the fragile 
bubble of space and time that 
bobbed along on a sea of mystery 
beyond which no mind could pene- 
trate. And yet, by the time that 
Man got where he was headed for, 
he might well be able to penetrate 
that, too. 

A MIRROR stood in one corner 
of the room and in it he 
saw the reflection of the lower 



136

half of his body, lying on the bed, 
naked except for a pair of shorts. 
He wiggled his toes and watched 
them in the glass. 

And you’re the only one who is 
stopping us, Trevor had told him. 
You're the one man standing in 
the way of Man. You’re the stum- 
bling block. You are keeping men 
from being gods. 

But all men did not think as 
Trevor did. All men were not 
tangled in the blind chauvinism of 
the human race. 

Always there are men who know 
that humanity is a single race, men 
who refuse to exploit other forms 
of life. Teachers. Missionaries. 
Vegetarians. Ordinary feeling hu- 
man beings. 

Even in his time, there had been 
men who treated androids sympa- 
thetically and Sutton had been one 
of them, though he knew now that 
it was the sympathy of the master 
for the underdog. The androids 
had not misunderstood; they knew 
it wasn’t equality that was offeree} 
or would be granted, that sym- 
pathy could turn to savage re- 
prisal if they acted as equals. Occa- 
sionally one would, swaggering 
and belligerent in the way of the 
frightened and insecure, and his 
ghastly fate served as example to 
others who might, as the saying 
went, get out of hand. 

For the human race, thought 
Sutton, cannot even for a moment 
forget that it is human, cannot 
achieve the greatness of humility 



that will unquestioningly accord 
equality. Even while the humane 
argue for the equality of androids, 
they cannot help but patronize the 
very ones that they would make 
equal. 

What was it Herkimer had 
said? Equality not by edict, not 
by human tolerance. But that was 
the only way the human race 
would ever accord equality . 
by edict, by dispensation, a ges- 
ture of tolerance where there was 
none, actually. 

A ND yet, thought Sutton, there 
is Eva Armour. 

There may be others like her. 
Somewhere, working with the and- 
roids even now, there may be 
others like her. 

He swung his feet out of bed 
and sat on the bed’s edge. A pair 
of slippers stood on the floor and 
he worked his feet into them, stood 
up and walked to the mirror. 

A strange face stared back at 
him, a face he’d never seen be- 
fore, and for a moment muddy 
panic surged within his brain. 

Then, sudden suspicion blos- 
soming, his hand went up to his 
forehead and rubbed at the smudge 
that was there, set obliquely 
across his brow. 

Bending low, with his face 
close to the mirror, he verified the 
thought. 

The smudge upon his brow was 
an android identification mark! An 
identification key and number!

W ITH his fingers he carefully 
explored his face, located 
the plastic coatings of flesh that 
had changed its contours until he 
was unrecognizable. 

He turned around, made his 
way back to the bed, sat down 
upon it cautiously and gripped the 
edge of the mattress with his 
.hands. 

Disguised, he told himself. 
Made into an android.. Kidnaped 
a human and an android when he 
woke. 

The door clicked and Herkimer 
said: "Good morning, sir. I trust 
that you are comfortable.” 

Sutton jerked erect. "So it was 
you,” he said. 

Herkimer nodded happily. "At 
your service, sir. Is there anything 
you wish?” 

"You didn’t have to knock me 
out,” said Sutton. "This is the 
second time. I’m getting tired of 
it.” 

"We had to work fast, sir,” said 
Herkimer. "We couldn't have you 
messing up things, stumbling 
around and asking questions and 
wanting to know what it was all 
about. We just drugged you and 
hauled you off. It was, believe me, 
sir, much simpler that way.” 
"There was some shooting,” 
Sutton said. "I heard the guns.” 
"It seems,” Herkimer told him, 
"that there were a few Revisionists 
lurking about, and it gets a little 
complicated, sir, when one tries to 
explain during a fight.” 



"You tangle with those Revi- 
sionists?” 

"Well, to tell the truth,” said 
Herkimer, "some of them were so 
rash as to draw their guns. It was 
most unwise of them, sir. They 
got the worst of it.” 

"It won’t do us a bit of good,” 
said Sutton, "if the idea was to 
get me out of the dutches of Trev- 
or’s mob. Trevor will have a psych 
tracer on me. He knows where I 
am and this place will be watched 
three deep.” 

Herkimer grinned. "It is, sir. 
His men are practically bumping 
into one another all around the 
place.” 

"Then why this get-up?” Sut- 
ton demanded angrily. "Why 
disguise me?” 

"Well, sir,” explained Herki- 
mer, "it’s like this. We figured no 
human in his right mind ever 
would want to be taken for an 
android. So we turned you into 
one. They’ll be looking for a hu- 
man. It would never occur to them 
to take a second look at an android 
when they were looking for a hu- 
man.” 

Sutton grunted. "Smart,”' he 
said. "I hope it doesn’t. .” 

."Oh, they’ll get onto it after a 
while, sir,” Herkimer admitted, 
cheerfully. "But it will give us 
some time. Time to work out some 
plans.” 

He moved swiftly around the 
room, opening chest drawers and 
taking out clothing.

"It’s very nice, sir,” he said, "to 
have you back again. We tried to 
■find you, but it was no dice. We 
figured the Revisionists had you 
cooped up somewhere, so we re- 
doubled our security here and kept 
a close watch on everything that 
happened. For the past five weeks 
we've known every move that 
Trevor and his gang has made.” 
"Five weeks!” gasped Sutton. 
"Did you say five weeks?” 

"Certainly, sir. Five weeks. You 
disappeared just seven weeks ago.” 
"By my calendar,” said Sutton, 
"it was ten years.” 

Herkimer wagged his head sage- 
ly, unstartled. "Time is the 
funniest thing, sir. There’s just no 
way to make subjective and objec- 
tive time come out right.” 

He laid clothing on the bed. "If 
you’ll get into these, sir, we’ll go 
down for breakfast. Eva is waiting 
— and will be glad to see you.”

T REVOR missed with three 
clips in a row. He flung 
the rest of them down on 
the desk. 

"You’re sure of this?” he asked 
the man across the desk. 

The man nodded, tight-lipped. 
"It might be android propa- 
ganda, you know,” said Trevor. 
"They’re clever. That’s a thing you 
never must forget. An android, for 
all his bowing and his scraping, is 
just as smart as we are." 



"Do you.realize what it means?” ■ 
the man demanded. "It means. .” 
”1 can tell you what it means,” 
said Trevor. "From now on we 
can’t be sure which of us are hu- 
man. There'll be no sure way of 
knowing who’s a human and who’s 
an android. You could be an an- 
droid. I could be. .” 

"Exactly,” said the man. 

"That’s why Sutton was so smug 
yesterday afternoon,” said Trevor. 
"He sat there, where you are sit- 
ting, and I had the impression that 
he was laughing at me all the 
time. 

”1 don’t think Sutton knows,” 
said the man. "It’s an android 
secret. Only a few of them know 
it. They certainly wouldn't take a 
chance on any human knowing it.” 
"Not even Sutton?” 

"Not even Sutton,” said the 
man. 

"Cradle,” said Trevor. "Nice 
sense of fitness they have.” 

"You’re going to do something 
about it, certainly," said the man 
impatiently. 

Trevor put his elbows on the 
desk and matched fingertips. 

"Of course I am,” he said. "Do 
you think I’d ever sit back and not 
do something?”

him, .planted a kiss on her up- 
turned lips. 

"That,” he said, "is for the mil- 
lion times I have thought of you.” 

She laughed at him, suddenly 
gay and happy. 

"Now, Ash, a million times?” 

"Tangled time," said Herkimer. 
"He’s been away ten years.” 

"Oh,” said Eva. "Oh, Ash, how 
horrible!” 

He grinned at her. "Not too 
horrible. I had ten years of rest. 
Ten years of peace and quiet. 
Working on a farm, you know. It 
was a little rough at first, but I was 
actually sorry when I had to leave. 
Except that it meant coming back 
to you.” 

He held a chair for her, took 
one himself between her and 
Herkimer. 

They ate . ham and eggs, 
toast and marmalade, strong, black 
coffee. It was pleasant on the patio. 
In the trees above them birds 
quarreled amiably. In the clover at 
the edge of the bricks and stones 
that formed the paving, bees hum- 
med among the blossoms. 

"How do you like my place. 
Ash?” asked Eva. 

"It’s wonderful,” he said, and 
then, as if the two ideas might be 
connected in some way, he added, 
"I saw Trevor yesterday. He took 
me to the mountain top and 
showed me the universe.” 

Eva drew in her breath sharply, 
and Sutton looked up quickly from 
his plate. Herkimer was waiting 



with drawn face, with fork poised 
in mid-air, halfway to his mouth. 

"What’s the matter with you 
two?” Sutton asked, offended. 
"Don’t you trust me?” 

And even as he, asked the ques- 
tion, he answered it himself. Of 
course they wouldn’t trust him. He 
was human and he could betray 
his own beliefs. He could twist 
destiny so that it was a thing for 
the human race alone. And there 
was no way in which they could 
be sure that he would not do this. 
Why should they trust a man who 
still felt uncomfortable and patron- 
izing eating with an android? For 
he did, even now, though he was 
ashamed and blamed a lifetime of 
conditioning. 

“Ash,” said Eva, "you refused 
to. 

"I left Trevor with an idea that 
I would be back to talk it over. 
Nothing that I said or did. He just 
believes I will. Told me to go out 
and beat my head against the wall 
some more.” 

"You have thought about it, 
sir?” asked Herkimer. 

Sutton shook his head. "No. 
Not too much. I haven’t sat down 
and mulled it over, if that is what 
you mean. It would have its points 
if I were merely human. Some- 
times I frankly wonder how much 
of the human there may be left in 
me.” 

"How much of it do you know, 
Ash?” Eva asked, speaking softly. 
Her eyes questioned him.

S UTTON scrubbed a hand 
across his forehead. "Most "of 
it, I think. I know about the war in 
time and how and why it’s being 
fought. I know about myself. I 
have two bodies and two minds, or 
at least substitute bodies and 
minds. I Icnow some of the things 
that I can do. There may be other 
abilities I do not know about. One 
grows into them. Each new thing 
comes hard.” 

"We couldn't tell you,” Eva 
said. "It would have been so sim- 
ple if we could have told you. To 
start with, you would not have be- 
lieved the things we told you. 
And, when dealing with time, one 
interferes as little as possible. Just 
enough to turn an event in the 
right direction. 

"I tried to warn you. Remember, 
Ash? As near as I could come to 
warning.” 

He nodded. "After I killed Ben- 
ton in the Zag House. You told 
mj you had studied me for twenty 
years.” 

"And, remember, I was the little 
girl in the checkered apron.” 

He looked at her in surprise. 
"You knew about that? It wasn't 
just part of the Zag dream?” 
"Identification planted by sug- 
gestion,” said Herkimer. "So that 
you could identify Eva as a friend, 
as someone you had known before 
and who was close to you. So that 
you would accept her and whatever 
help she was allowed to offer.” 
"But it was a dream.” 



"A Zag dream,” said Herkimer. 
"The Zag is one of us. His race 
would benefit if destiny can stand 
for everyone and not the human 
race alone.” 

UTTON said: "Trevor is too 
confident. Not just pretending 
to be confident, but really confi- 
dent. I keep coming back to that 
remark he made. Go out, he said, 
and butt your head some more.” 

"He’s counting on you as a 
human being,” Eva said. 

Sutton shook his head. "I can’t 
think that’s it. He must have some 
scheme up his sleeve, some 
maneuver that we won’t be able to 
check.” 

Herkimer spoke slowly. "I don’t 
like that, sir. The war’s not going 
too well as it is. If we had to win, 
we’d be lost right now.” 

"If we had to win? I don’t un- 
derstand . .” 

"We don’t have to win, sir,” 
said Herkimer. "All we have to 
do is fight a holding action, pre- 
vent the Revisionists from destroy- 
ing the book as you will write it. 
From the very first we have not 
tried to change a single entry. 
We’ve tried to keep them from 
being changed.” 

Sutton nodded. "On his part, 
Trevor has to win decisively. He 
must smash the original text, either 
prevent it from being written as I 
mean to write it or discredit it so 
thoroughly that not even an android 
will believe it.”

"You're right, sir,” Herkimer 
told him. "Unless he can do that, 
the humans cannot claim destiny 
for their own, cannot make other 
life believe that destiny is reserved 
for the human race alone." 

"And that is all he wants,” said 
Eva. "Not the destiny itself, for no 
human can have the faith in destiny 
that say, for example, an android 
can. To Trevor it is merely a mat- 
ter of propaganda ... to make the 
human race believe so completely 
that it is destined that it will not 
rest until it holds the universe.” 

"So long,” said Herkimer, "as 
we can keep him from doing that, 
we can state that we are winning. 
But the issue is so finely balanced 
that a new approach by either side 
would score heavily. A new wea- 
pon could be a factor that would 
mean victory or defeat.” 

"I have a weapon,” Sutton said. 
"A made-to-order weapon that 
would beat them . but there's 
no way that it can be used.” 

Neither of them asked the ques- 
tion, but he saw it on their faces 
and he answered it. 

"There’s only one such weapon. 
Only one gun. You can’t fight a 
war with just one gun.” 

Feet pounded around the corner 
of the house. When they turned, 
they saw an android running to- 
ward them across the patio. Dust 
stained his clothing and his face 
was red from running. He came to 
a stop and faced them, clutching at 
the table's edge. 



"They tried to kill me,” he 
panted, the words coming out 
in gushes. "The place is sur- 
rounded . .” 

"Andrew, you fool,” snapped 
Herkimer. "What do you mean by 
running in like this? They will 
know ...” • 

"They've found out about the 
Cradle,” Andrew gasped. "They 
know. .” 

Herkimer came erect in one swift 
motion. The chair on which he had 
been sitting tipped over with the 
violence of his rising and 'his face 
was suddenly so white that the 
identification tattoo on his fore- 
head stood out with startling 
clearness. 

"They know where . .?” 



A NDREW shook his head. "Not 
where. They just found out 
about it. Just now. We still have 
time ...” 



"We’ll call in all the ships,” said 
Herkimer. "We'll have to pull all 
the guards off the crisis points . „ .” 
"But you can’t,” cried 'Eva. 
"That’s exactly what they would 
would want you to do. That is all 
that is stopping them . .” 

"We have to,” Herkimer said 
grimly. "There's no choice. If they 
destroy the Cradle . .” 

"Herkimer,” said Eva, and there 
was a deadly calm in her unhurried 
words. "The mark!” 

Andrew swung around toward 
her, then took a backward step. 
Herkimer’s hand flashed under- 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



neath his coat and Andrew turned 
to run, heading for the low wall 
that rimmed the patio. 

The knife in Herkimer’s hand 
flashed in the Sun and was sud- 
denly a spinning wheel that tracked 
the running android. It caught him 
before he reached the wall and he 
went down into a heap of huddled 
clothing. 

The knife, Sutton saw, was neatly 
buried in his neck. 

XLV 

t C~1 ■” AVE you noticed, sir,” 

I — I said Herkimer, "how 
I I the little things, the 
inconsequential, trivial factors come 
to play so big a part in any hap- 
pening?” 

He touched the huddled body 
with his foot. 

"Perfect,” he said. "Absolutely 
perfect. Except that before report- 
ing to us, he should have smeared 
some lacquer over his identification 
mark. Many androids do it in an 
attempt to hide the mark, but it’s 
seldom much of a success. After 
only a short time, the mark shows 
through.” 

"But lacquer?” asked Sutton. 

"A little code we have,” said 
Herkimer. "A very simple thing. 
It’s the recognition sign for an 
agent reporting. A password, as it 
were. It takes a moment only. Some 
lacquer on your finger and a smear 
across your forehead.” 

"So simple a thing,” said Eva, 



"that no one, absolutely no one, 
would ever notice it.” 

Sutton nodded. "One of Trevor’s 
men ?” 

Herkimer nodded. "Impersonat- 
ing one of our men. Sent to smoke 
us out. Sent to start us running, 
panicked to save the Cradle.” 

"This Cradle. .” 

"But it means,” said Eva, "that 
Trevor knows about it. He doesn’t 
know where it is, but he knows 
about it. And he’ll hunt until he 
finds it and then. .” 

Herkimer’s gesture stopped her. 
"What is wrong?” asked Sutton. 
For there was something wrong, 
something that was terribly wrong. 
The whole atmosphere of the place 
had grown harsh. The friendliness 
was gone . the trust and friend- 
liness and the oneness of their pur- 
pose. Shattered by an android who 
had run across the patio and talked 
about a thing that he called a Cra- 
dle and died, seconds later, with a 
knife blade through his throat. 

Instinctively Sutton’s mind 
reached out for Herkimer and then 
he drew it back. It was not an 
ability, he told himself, that one 
used upon a friend. It was an abil- 
ity that one must keep in trust, not 
to be used curiously or idly, but 
only where the end result would 
justify its use. 

"What's gone sour?” he asked. 
"What is the matter?” 

"Sir,” said Herkimer, ’“you are a 
human being and this is ah android 
matter.” 



TIME QUARRY 



143 



For a moment Sutton stood stiff 
and straight, his mind absorbing 
the shock of the words that Herki- 
mer had spoken, the black fury 
boiling ice cold inside his body. 

Then, deliberately, as if he had 
planned to do it, as if it was an 
action he had decided upon after 
long consideration, he made a tight 
fist and swung his arm. 

It was a vicious blow, with all 
his weight and all his strength and 
anger back of it, and Herkimer 
went down like an ox beneath a 
hammer. 

“Ash!" cried Eva. 

She clutched at his arm, but he 
shook her off. 



H erkimer was sitting up, his 
hands covering his face, blood 
dripping down between his fingers. 

Sutton spoke to him. "I have not 
sold destiny, nor do I intend to 
sell it. Although, God 'knows, if I 
did, it would be no more than the 
lot of you deserve.” 

"Ash,” said Eva softly. "Ash, 
we must be sure.” 

"How can I make you sure?” he 
asked. "I can only tell you.” 

"They are your people. Ash,” 
she said. “Your race. Their great- 
ness is your greatness, too. You 
can't blame Herkimer for think- 
ing. ...” 

"They’re your people, too,” said 




144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Sutton. "The taint that applies to 
me applies to you as well.” 

She shook her head. 

"I’m a special case,” she said. "I 
was orphaned when I was only a 
few weeks old. The family androids 
took me over. They raised me. 
Herkimer was one of them. I’m 
much more an android, Ash, than 
I am a human being.” 

Herkimer was still sitting on the 
grass, beside the sprawled, dead 
body of Trevor’s agent. He did 
not take his hands from his face. 
He made no sign that he was going 
to. The blood still dripped down 
between his finger and trickled 
down his arms. 

Sutton said to Eva: "It was very 
nice to see you again. And thank 
you for the breakfast.” 

He turned on his heel and 
walked away, across the patio and 
over the low wall and out into the 
path that led down to the road. 

He heard Eva cry out for him to 
stop, but he pretended not to hear 
her. 

I was raised by androids, she had 
said. And he had been raised by 
Buster, a robot, not even an an- 
droid. By Buster, who had taught 
him how to fight when the kid 
down the road had given him a 
licking. Buster, who had whaled 
him good and proper for eating 
green apples. By Buster, who had 
gone out, five hundred years be- 
fore, to homestead a planet. 

Sutton walked with the icy fury 
still running in his blood. They 



TIME QUARRY 



didn’t trust me, he said. They 
thought I might sell out. After all 
the years of waiting, after all the 
years of planning and of thinking. 

"Johnny,’’ he said. 

"What is it, Ash?” 

"What’s going on, Johnny? 
What about all this?" 

"You’re a stinker. Ash.” 

"To hell with you,” said Sutton. 
"You and all the rest of them.” 

Trevor’s men, he 'knew, must be 
around the house, watching and 
waiting. He expected to be stopped. 
But he wasn’t stopped. He didn’t 
see a soul. 

XLYI 

UTTON stepped into the 
visor booth and closed the 
door behind him. From the 
rack along the wall, he took out 
the directory and hunted up the 
number. He dialed and snapped the 
toggle and there was a robot on 
the screen. 

"Information,” said the robot, 
his eyes seeking out the forehead 
of the man who called. Since it was 
an android, he dropped the cus- 
tomary "sir.” 

"Information. Records. What 
can I do for you?" 

"Is there any possibility,” asked 
Sutton, "that this call could be 
tapped?” 

"None,” said the robot. - "Abso- 
lutely none. You see . .” 

"I want to see the homestead 
filings for the year 7990.” 



"Earth filings?" 

Sutton nodded. 

"Just a moment,” said the 
robot. 

Sutton waited, watching the 
robot select the proper spool and 
mount it on the viewer. 

"They are arranged alphabetical- 
ly,” said the robot. "What name 
did you wish?” 

"The name begins with ’S’,” 
said Sutton. "Let me see the ’S’s.” 

The unwinding spool was a blur 
on the screen. It slowed momen- 
tarily at the "M”s, spun to the 
”P”s, then went more slowly. 

The "S” list dragged by. 

"Toward the end,” said Sutton, 
and, finally, "Hold it.” 

For there was the entry that he 
sought. 

Sutton, Buster . 

He read the planet description 
three times to make sure he had it 
firmly in his mind. 

"That’s all,” he said. "Thank 
you very much.” 

The robot grumbled at him and 
shut off the screen. 

Outside again, Sutton ambled 
easily across the foyer of the office 
building he had selected to place 
his call. On the road outside, he 
walked up the road, branched off 
onto a path and found a bench 
with a pleasant view. 

He sat down on the bench and 
forced himself to relax. 

He was being watched, he knew. 
Kept under observation, for by 
this time, certainly, Trevor would 




146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



know that the android who had 
walked out of Eva Armour’s house 
was actually Asher Sutton. The 
psych tracer long ago would have 
told the story, would have traced 
his movements and pin-pointed 
him for Trevor’s men to watch. 

Take it easy, he told himself. 
Dawdle. Loaf. Act as if you didn’t 
have a thing to do, as if you 
didn’t have a thought in mind. 

You can’t fool them, but you 
can at least catch them unguarded 
when you have to move. 

And there were many things to 
do, many things left to think 
about, although he was satisfied 
that the course of action he had 
planned was the course to take. 

He took them up, step by step, 
checking them over for any chance 
of slip-up. 

F IRST, back to Eva’s house to 
get the manuscript notes he 
■had left on the hunting asteroid, 
notes that either Eva or Herkimer 
must have kept through all the 
years ... or was it only weeks? 

That would be a ticklish and em- 
barrassing business at the best. But 
they were his notes, he told him- 
self. They were his to claim. He 
had no commitments in this con- 
flict. 

"I have come to get my notes. I 
suppose you still have them some- 
where.” 

Or — ''Remember the attache case 
I had ? I wonder if you took care of 
it for me.” 



Or — "I'm going on a trip. I’d 
appreciate my notes if you can lay 
your hands on them.” 

Or — 

But it was no use. However he 
might say it, whatever he might 
do, the first step would be to re- 
claim the notes. 

Dawdle up till then, he told 
himself. Work your way back to- 
ward the house until it’s almost 
dark. Then get the notes and after 
that move fast — so fast that 
Trevor’s gang can’t catch up with 
you. 

Second was the ship, the ship 
that he must steal. 

He had spotted it earlier in the 
day while loafing at the area space- 
port. Sleek and small, it would be 
a fast job, and the stiff, military 
bearing of the officer who had been 
directing the provisioning and re- 
fueling had been the final tip-off 
that it was the ship he wanted. 

Loafing outside the barrier fence, 
playing the part of an idly curious, 
no-good android, he had carefully 
entered the officer’s mind. Ten min- 
utes later, he was on his way, with 
the information that he needed. 

The ship did carry a time-warp 
unit. 

It was not taking off until the 
next morning. 

It would be guarded during the 
night. 

Without a doubt, Sutton told 
himself, one of Trevor’s ships, one 
of the fighting warships of the Re- 
visionists. 



TIME QUARRY 



147 



It would take nerve, he knew, to 
steal the ship. Nerve and fast foot- 
work and a readiness and the 
ability to kill. 

Saunter out onto the field, as if 
he were waiting for an incoming 
ship, mingling with the crowd. 
Slip out of the crowd and walk 
across the field, acting, as if he had 
a right to be there. Not run . 
walk. Run only if someone chal- 
lenged him and made the chal- 
lenge stick. Run then. Fight. Kill, 
if necessary. But get the ship. 

Get the ship and pile on the 
speed to the limit of endurance, 
heading in a direction away from 
his destination, driving the ship 
with everything that was in it. 

Two years out, or sooner if nec- 
essary, he would throw in the time 
unit, roll himself and the ship a 
couple of centuries into the past. 

Once in the past, he would have 
to ditch the motors, for undoubted- 
ly they would have built-in recog- 
nition signals which could be 
traced. Unship them and let them 
travel in the direction he had been 
going. 

T HEN take over the empty 'hull 
with his non-human body, 
swing around and head toward 
Buster’s planet, still piling on the 
speed, building it up to that fan- 
tastic figure that was necessary to 
jump great interstellar spaces. 

Vaguely he wondered how his 
body, how the drive of 'his energy- 
intake body, would compare with 

148 



the actual motors in the long haul. 
Better, he decided. Better than the 
motors. Faster and stronger. 

But it would take years — many 
years of time, for Buster was far 
out. 

He listed the moves: 

Unshipping the engines would 
throw off pursuit. The pursuers 
would follow the recognition-sig- 
nals in the motors, would spend 
long days in overhauling them be- 
fore they discovered their mistake. 

'Check. 

The time roll would unhook the 
contact of Trevor’s psych tracers, 
for they could not operate through 
time. 

Check. 

By the time other tracers could 
be set in other times to find him, 
he would be so far out that the 
tracers would go insane trying to 
catch up on the time-lag of his 
whereabouts — if, in fact, they could 
ever find it in the vastness of the 
outer reaches of the galaxy.; 

Check. 

If it works, he thought. If it only 
works. If there isn’t some sort of 
slip-up, some kind of unseen factor. 

A squirrel skipped across the 
grass, sat up on its haunches and 
took a long look at him. Then, de- 
ciding that 'he was not dangerous, 
it started a busy search in the grass 
for imaginary buried treasure. 

Cut loose, thought Sutton. Cut 
loose from everything that holds 
me. Cut loose and get the job 
done. Forget Trevor and his Re-

visionists, forget Herkimer and the 
androids. Forget Eva. Get the book 
written. 

Trevor wants to buy me. Eva 
wants to use me; I'm nothing to 
her as a man. And the androids 
do not trust me. And Morgan, if 
he had the chance, would kill me. 

The androids do not trust me. 

That’s foolish, he told himself. 

Childish. 

And yet they did not trust him. 
You are a human, Eva had told 
him. The humans are your people. 
I’m much more an android. Ash, 
than I am a human being. 

iHe shook his head, bewildered 
by the situation. 

There was one thing that stood 
out clearly. One thing he had to do. 
One obligation that was his and 
one that must be fulfilled or all 
else would be with utterly no 
meaning. 

There is a thing called destiny. 

The knowledge of that destiny 
has been granted me. Not as a hu- 
man being, not as a member of' the 
human race, but as an instrument 
to transmit that knowledge to all 
other thinking life. 

I must write a book to do it. ■ 

I must make that book as clear 
and forceful and as honest as I 
can. 

Having done that, I shall have 
discharged my responsibility. 

Having done that, it does not 
matter what may happen to me. 

Having done that, there is no 
further claim upon me. 



A footstep sounded on the path 
back of the bench and Sutton 
turned arotlnd. 

"Mr. Sutton, isn’t it?” said the 
man. 

Sutton nodded. 

"Sit down, Trevor,” he said. 
"I’ve been expecting you.”

with your friends," said 
m Trevor. 

Sutton shook his head. "We had 
a disagreement.” 

"Something about this Cradle 
business?” 

"You might call it that,” said 
Sutton. "It goes a good deal 
deeper. The fundamental prejudices 
rooted between androids and hu- 
mans.” 

"Herkimer killed an android 
who brought him a message about 
the Cradle,” Trevor said. 

"He thought it was someone that 
you sent. Someone masquerading as 
an android. That is why he killed 
him.” 

Trevor pursed his mouth sanc- 
timoniously. "Too bad,” he said. 
"Too bad. Mind telling me how 
he recognized the . might we 
call it the deception?” 

“That is something,” Sutton said, 
"that you will have to figure out 
without my help." 

Trevor labored at -acting un- 
concerned. "The main point is,” he 
said, "that it didn’t work.”

"You mean the androids didn't 
run helter-skelter for the Cradle 
and show you where itr was.” 

Trevor nodded. "There was an- 
other angle to it, too. They might 
have pulled some of their guards 
off the crisis points. That would 
have helped us some.” 

"Double-barreled,” said Sutton. 
"Very shrewd.” 

"Oh, most assuredly,” agreed 
Trevor. "Nothing like getting the 
other fellow square behind the 
eight-ball.” 

He squinted at Sutton’s face. 

"Since when,” he asked, "and 
why did you desert the human 
race?” 

Sutton put his hand up to his 
face, felt the resilience of the plas- 
tic that had remodeled his features 
into those of another person. 

"It was Herkimer’s idea,” he 
declared. "He thought it would 
make me hard to spot. You 
wouldn’t be looking for an an- 
droid, you know.” 

Trevor nodded agreement. "It 
might have helped,” he said. "It 
would have fooled us for a while, 
but when you walked away and the 
tracer followed you, we knew who 
you were.” 

The squirrel came hopping across 
the grass and looked them over. 

"Sutton,” Trevor asked, "how 
much do you know about this Cra- 
dle business?” 

"Nothing,” Sutton replied. 
"They told me I was a human and 
it was an android matter.” 



"You can see from that how 
important it must be.” 

"I think I can,” said Sutton. 
"You can guess, just from the 
name, what it might be.” 

"That's not too hard to do.” 
"Because we needed a greater 
force of humans,” said Trevor, "we 
made the first androids a thousand 
years ago. We needed them to fill 
out the too-thin ranks of Mankind. 
We made them as close to humans 
as we could. They could do every- 
thing the humans could except one 
thing.” 

"They can’t reproduce,” said 
Sutton. "I wonder, Trevor, assum- 
ing it had been possible, whether 
we would have given that power to 
them, too. If we had, they would 
•have been true humans. There 
would have been no difference 
whatever between men whose an- 
cestors were made in a laboratory 
and those whose ancestors stemmed 
back to the primal ocean. The an- 
droids would have been a self-con- 
tinuing race, and they wouldn’t 
have been androids. They would 
have been humans. We would have 
been adding to our population by 
biological as well as chemical 
means.” 

DON’T know,” said Trevor. 

X "Honestly, I don’t. Of course, 
the wonder is that we could make 
them at all, that we could produce 
life in the laboratory. Think of the 
sheer intellectual ability and the 
technical skill that went into it.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



For centuries men had tried to find 
out what life was, had run down 
one blind alley after another, get- 
ting nowhere near the secret at all. 
Failing in a scientific answer, many 
of them turned back to a divine 
source, to a mythical answer, to the 
belief that it was a matter of su- 
pernatural intervention. The idea is 
perfectly expressed by du Nouy, 
who wrote back in the twentieth 
century.” 

"We gave the androids one thing 
we do not have ourselves,” said 
Sutton, calmly. 

Trevor stared at him, suddenly 
hard, suddenly suspicious. 

"You. .” 

"We gave them inferiority,” said 
Sutton. "We made them less than 
human and that gave them a reason 
to fight us. We denied them some- 
thing they haye to fight to get . 
equality. We furnished them with a 
motive Man lost long ago, .though 
he still has a need to feel superior 
to other humans for some arbitrary 
and unimportant difference. Once 
it was religion, nationality, the 
color of the skin. Now it's the abil- 
ity to reproduce.” 

"They’re equal now," said 
Trevor, bitterly. "The androids 
have been reproducing themselves 
. chemically, not biologically, 
■for a long time now.” 

"We should have expected it,” 
said Sutton. 

"I suppose we should have,” 
Trevor admitted. "We gave them 
the same brains we have ourselves. 



We gave them — or we tried to give 
them — a human perspective." 

"And we .put a mark upon their 
foreheads.” 

T revor made an angry motion 
with his hand. "That little mat- 
ter is being taken care of now. 
When the androids make another 
android, they don’t bother to put 
a mark upon his head.” 

Sutton started as the thunder hit 
him . thunder that rolled and 
rumbled in his brain, a growing, 
painful, roaring thunder that shut 
out everything. 

He had said a weapon. He had 
said there was a weapon . 

"They could make themselves 
better than they were originally,” 
continued Trevor. "They could im- 
prove upon the model. They could 
build a super-race, a mutant race, 
call it what you will . .” 

Only one weapon, Sutton had 
said. And you can’t fight with just 
one cannon. 

Sutton put a hand up to his fore- 
head, rubbed hard against his brow. 

"Sure,” said Trevor. "You can 
go nuts thinking about it. I have. 
You can conjure up all sorts of 
possibilities. They could push us 
out. The new pushing out the old.” 
"The race would be human still,” 
said Sutton. 

"We built slowly, Sutton. The 
old race. The biological race. We 
came up from the dawn of Man. 
We came up from chipped flints 
and fist axe, from the cave and the

treetop nest. We’ve built too slowly 
and painfully and bloodily to have 
our heritage taken from us by 
something to which that slowness 
and the pain and blood would 
mean not a thing at all.” 

One gun, Sutton thought. But 
he had been wrong. There were a 
thousand guns, a million guns, 
to save destiny for all life that was 
or would be. Now or a million- 
billion years from now. 

"I suppose,” he said, shakily, 
"that you feel I should throw in 
with you.” 

"I want you,” said Trevor, "to 
find out for me where the Cradle 
is. You could get the androids to 
tell you." 

"So you can smash it.” 

"So I can save humanity. The 
old humanity. The real humanity.” 
"You feel that all humans 
should stick together now.” 

"If you have a streak of human 
in you, you will be with us now.” 
"There was a time,” said Sut- 
ton, "back on Earth, before men 
went to the stars, when the human 
race was the most important thing 
the mind of Man could know. 
That isn't true any longer, Trevor. 
There are other races just as great. 
Either actually or potentially.” 
"Each race,” answered Trevor, 
"is loyal to its own. The human 
race must be loyal unto itself.” 

"I am going to be traitor. I may 
be wrong, but I still think that 
destiny is greater than humanity.” 
"You refuse to help us?” 



' Not only that,” said Sutton. "I 
am going to fight you. If you want 
to kill me, Trevor, now's the time 
to do it. Because if you don’t do 
it now, it will be too late.” 

"I wouldn’t kill you for all the 
worlds,” Trevor assured him cold- 
ly. "I need the words you wrote. 
Despite you and the androids, Sut- 
ton, we’ll read them the way we 
want them read. And so will all 
the other slimy, crawling things 
you admire so much. There’s noth- 
ing in the whole universe that can 
stand before the human race, that 
can match the human race. .” 
Sutton saw loathing on his face. 
"I'm leaving you to yourself, 
Sutton,” Trevor told him. "Your 
name will go down as the blackest 
blot in all of human history. The 
syllables of your name will be a 
sound that the last human will 
gag upon if he tries to speak it. 
Sutton will become a common 
noun with which one man will 
insult another. .” 

Trevor stood up and started to 
walk away and then turned back. 
His voice was not much more than 
a whisper, but it cut into Sutton’s 
brain like a whetted knife. 

"Go and wash your face,” he 
said. "Wash off the plastic and 
the mark. But you’ll never be hu- 
man again, Sutton. You’ll never 
dare to call yourself a man again.” 
He turned on his heel and 
walked away. Staring at his back, 
Sutton seemed to hear the sound 
of a slamming door.

XL VIII 

T HERE was one lamp light- 
ed in a corner of the room. 
The attache case lay on a 
table underneath the lamp and 
Eva Armour was standing beside 
a chair, as if she had been expect- 
ing him. 

"You came back," said Eva, "to 
get your notes. I have them ready 
for you.” 

He stood just inside the door 
and shook his head. 

"Not yet,” he said. "Later I 
will need the notes. Not tight 
now.” 

And there it was, he thought! 
the thing he had worried about 
that afternoon, the thing that he 
had tried to put in words. 

"I told you about a weapon at 
breakfast this morning,” he went 
on. "You must remember what I 
said about it. I said there was only 
one weapon. I said you can’t fight 
a war with just one gun.” . 

Eva nodded, her lovely face 
drawn in tire lamplight. "I remem- 
ber, Ash.” 

"There are a million of them," 
said Ash. "As many as you want. 
There’s no limit to the number 
there can be." 

He moved slowly across the 
room until he stood face to face 
with her. 

"I am on your side,” he told 
her, simply. "I saw Trevor this 
afternoon. He cursed me for all 
humanity.” 



Slowly she put up a hand and 
he felt it slide across his face, the 
palm cool and smooth. Her fin- 
gers closed in his hair ajid she 
shook his head gently, tenderly. 

"Ash,” she said, "you washed 
the plastic off your face. You are 
Ash again.” 

He nodded. "I wanted to be 
human again.” 

"Trevor told you about the 
Cradle, Ash?” 

"I’d guessed some of it,” Sutton 
said. "He told me the rest. About 
the androids that wear no mark.” 

"We use them as spies,” she 
said, as if it were quite a natural 
thing to say. "We even have some 
of them in Trevor’s headquarters.. 
He thinks that they are human.” 

"Herkimer?” he asked. 

"He isn’t here, Ash. He would- 
n’t be here, after what happened 
out on the patio.” 

"Of course,” said Sutton. "Of 
course he wouldn’t. Eva, we hu- 
mans are such heels.” 

"Sit down,” she told him. "That 
chair over there. You talk so oddly 
that you scare me.” 

He sat down. 

"Tell me what happened,” she 
demanded. 

He didn’t tell her. He said: "I 
thought of Herkimer this after- 
noon. When Trevor was talking 
with me. I hit Herkimer this morn- 
ing and I would hit him tomorrow 
morning if he said the same thing 
to nie. It’s something in the hu- 
man blood, Eva. We fought our 



TIME QUARRY 



155 



way up. With fist, axe and club 
and gun and atom bomb and. 

"Shut up,” cried Eva. "Keep 
still, c«n’t you?” 

He looked up at her in aston- 
ishment. 

"Human, you say,” she said 
harshly. "And what is Herkimer 
if he isn’t human? He is a human, 
made by humans. A robot can 
make another robot and they’re 
still robots, aren't they? A human 
makes another human and both 
of them are humans.” 

S UTTON mumbled, confused. 

"Trevor is afraid the androids 
will take over. That there will be 
no more humans. No more orig- 
inal, biological humans. 

"Ash,” she said, "you are both- 
ering yourself over something that 
there is no reason to fight. The 
Cradle will solve the secret of 
biological reproduction. Not for 
centuries, of course, but ultimately. 
What’s the use of agonizing over 
a difference that eventually won’t 
exist?" 

He shook his head. "I guess 
there is no use. It keeps stirring 
around in my head, though, accus- 
ing me of treason. Once it was so 
clear and simple. I would write a 
book and the galaxy would read 
it and accept it and everything 
would be just fine.” 

"It still can be that way,” she 
said. "After a while, after a long 
while. When Man stops believing 
that racial loyalty means the right 



to subjugate all other life. It will 
come, Ash, and humanity will be 
greater for it, allied to everything 
that lives, not an arrogant and 
fearful master.” 

"Herkimer said one weapon 
would do it," Sutton said. “One 
weapon would be the balance that 
was needed. Eva, the androids have 
gone a long way in their research, 
haven’t they? Chemical, I mean. 
The study of the human body. 
They would have to, to do what 
they have done.” 

She nodded. "A long way, 
Ash.” 

"They have a scanner ... a 
machine that could take a person 
apart, molecule by molecule, re- 
cord it almost atom for atom. 
Make a blueprint for another 
body.” 

"We've done that,” said Eva. 
"We’ve duplicated men in Trev- 
or’s organization. Kidnaped them 
and blueprinted them and made a 
duplicate . sent him back the 
duplicate and placed the other un- 
der benevolent detention. It’s only 
been through tricks like that that 
we’ve been able to hold our own 
at all.” 

"You could duplicate me?” 
asked Sutton. 

"Certainly, Ash, but. .” 

"A different face, of course,” 
said Sutton. "But a duplicate brain 
and . well, a few other things.” 

Eva nodded. "Your special abil- 
ities.” 

”1 can get into another mind,” 



1 56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said Sutton. "Not mere telepathy, 
but the actual power to be another 
person, to be that other mind, to 
see and know and feel the same 
things that the other mind may 
see or know or feel. I don’t know 
how it’s done, but it must be 
something inherent in the brain 
structure. If you duplicated my 
brain, the ability should go along 
with the duplication. Not all of 
the duplicates would have it, may- 
be, not all of them could use it, 
but some of them could.” 

She gasped. "Ash, that would 
mean. 

<< "\7'OU would know every- 

X thing,” said Sutton, "that 
Trevor thinks. Every word and 
thought that passes through his 
mind. Because one of you would 
be Trevor. And the same with 
every other person who has any- 
thing to do with the war in time. 
You would know as soon as they 
know what they’re going to do. 
You could plan to meet any threat 
they might be considering. You 
could block them at everything 
they tried.” 

"It would be stalemate," Eva 
said, "and that is exactly what we 
want. A strategy of stalemate, Ash. 
They wouldn’t know how they 
were being blocked and many 
times they would not know who 
was blocking them. It would seem 
to them that luck was permanent- 
ly against them . , that destiny 
was against them.” 



"Trevor himself gave me the 
idea,” Sutton said. "He told me 
to go out and butt my head against 
a wall some more. He told me 
that finally I would get tired of 
doing it He said that after a 
while I would give up.” 

"Ten years,” said Eva. "Ten 
years should do the job. But if ten 
won’t, why, then, a hundred. Or a 
thousand, if it must take that long. 
We have all the time there is.” 
"Finally,” said Sutton, "they 
would give up. Literally throw up 
their hands and quit. It would be 
such a futile thing. Never win- 
ning. Always fighting hard and 
never winning.” 

They sat in the room with its 
one little oasis of light that stood 
guard against the darkness that 
pressed in upon them, and there 
was no triumph in them, for this 
was not a thing of triumph. This 
was a matter of necessity, not one 
of conquest. This was Man fight- 
ing himself, and winning and los- 
ing at the same time. 

"You can arrange this scanning 
soon?” asked Sutton. 

"Tomorrow, Ash.” She looked 
at him queerly. "What’s your 
hurry?” 

”1 am leaving,” Sutton said. 
"Running away to a refuge that I 
thought of. That is, if you’ll lend 
me a ship.” 

"Any ship you want.” 

"It would be more convenient 
that way,” he told her. "Other- 
wise, I’d have to steal one.” 



TIME QUARRY 



157 



She did not ask the question 
that he had expected and he went 
on: "I have to write the book.” 

"There are plenty of places. 
Ash, where you could write the 
book. Safe places. Places that could 
be arranged to be foolproof safe.” 

He shook his head. "There’s an 
old robot. He's the only folks I 
have. When I was on Cygni, he 
went out to one of the star sys- 
tems at the very edge and filed on 
a homestead. I am going there.” 

"I understand,” she said, speak- 
ing very softly. 

"There’s just one thing,” said 
Sutton. "I keep remembering a 
little girl who came and spoke to 
me when I was fishing. I know 
that she was a person conditioned 
in my mind. I know she was put 
there for a purpose, but it makes 
no difference. I keep thinking of 
her.” 

He looked at Eva and saw how 
the lamplight turned her hair into 
a copper glory. 

”1 don’t know if I am still 
allowed to love,” said Sutton. "I 
can’t tell you for sure if I will 
always' be allowed to love you, 
Eva. But I wish you would go with 
me out to Buster’s planet.” 

”1 can’t,” she cried. "Don’t ask 
me to.” 

"But I must. I’ve suffered 
enough alone. I deserve you, 
don’t I?” 

Her eyes were misty in the 
lamplight. "Perhaps sometime. 
Ash, if you still want me. But 



there’s this war that must not be 
lost. ...” 

. Sutton said, simply: "I’ll al- 

ways want you, Eva. The war can’t 
be lost any more.” 

She was against him, her lips 
to his, her words muffled and hun- 
gry. "I want to. Oh, I want to.” 

XLIX 

S UTTON floated in a sea of 
light and from far away he 
heard the humming of the 
machines at work, little busy ma- 
chines that were dissecting him 
with their tiny fingers of probing 
light and clicking shutters and the 
sensitive paper that ran like a 
streak of burnished silver through 
the holders. Dissecting and weigh- 
ing, probing and measuring . 
missing nothing, adding nothing. 
A faithful record not of himself 
alone, but of every particle of him, 
of every cell and molecule, of 
every branching nerve and muscle 
fiber. 

And from somewhere else, also 
far away, from a place beyond the 
sea of light that held him, a voice 
said one word and kept repeating 
it: 

Traitor. 

Traitor. 

Traitor. 

One word without an exclama- 
tion point. A voice that had no 
emphasis. One flat word. 

First there had been one voice 
crying it and then another joined 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and then there was a crowd and 
finally it was a roaring mob and 
the sound and word built up until 
it was a world of voices that were 
crying out the word. Crying out 
the word until there was no longer 
any meaning in it, until it had lost 
its meaning and become a sound 
being senselessly repeated. 

Sutton tried to answer and there 
was no answer nor any way to 
answer. He had no voice, for he 
had no lips or tongue or throat. 
He was an entity that floated in 
the sea of light and the word kept 
on, never changing . never 
stopping. 

But back of the word, a back- 
ground to the word, there were 
other words unspoken. 

We are the ones who clicked 
the flints together and built the 
first fire of Man’s own making. 
We are the ones who drove the 
beasts out of the caves and took 
them for ourselves, in which to 
shape the first pattern of a human 
civilization. We are the ones who 
painted the colorful bison on the 
hidden walls, working in the light 
of mud lamps with moss for wicks 
and animal fat for oil. We are the 
ones who tilled the soil and tamed 
the seed to grow beneath our hand. 
We are the ones who built great 
cities that our own kind might 
live together and accomplish the 
greatness that a handful could not 
even try. We are the ones who 
dreamed of stars — and broke the 
atom to the harness of our minds. 



It is our heritage you spend. It 
is our traditions that you give away 
to things that we have made, that 
we have fashioned with the deft- 
ness of our hands and the sharp- 
ness of our minds. 

The machines clicked on and 
the voice kept on with the one 
word it was saying. 

But there was another voice, 
deep within the undefinable being 
that was Asher Sutton, a faint 
voice. 

It said no word, for there was 
no word that could frame the 
thought it formed. It made him 
kin to something far greater than 
a race of thinking, brawling, am- 
bitious primates. It made him kin 
to all life ... all life. 

Sutton answered it. "Thank you, 
Johnny. Thank you very much.” 

And he was astonished that he 
could answer Johnny when he 
could not answer all the others. 

The machines went on with 
their clicking. 

L 

H erkimer stood alone in 
the darkness underneath 
the trees and watched the 
two of them walk across the field 
toward the ship. 

She should have stayed, . he 
thought. He would have gone 
without her. He would not have 
guessed the real reason why she 
should have stayed. No more than 
he guesses even now that we sent 



TIME QUARRY 



159 



Buster out to the Tower stars 
many years ago to establish refuge 
for him — well knowing that the 
day might come when he would 
need that refuge. 

She had told him at first that 
she couldn’t go with him. She 
should have stuck it out, thought 
Herkimer. But she is too human. 
That is the trouble with all of us. 
— we are too human. 

Out on the tiny field, fire flick- 
ered in the mouths of the tubes 
and the silvery ship lurched down 
the launching ramp. Gathering 
speed, it slammed along the up- 
curve and hurled itself into the 
sky, a breath of fire that blazed 
against the night. 



Herkimer stood with tilted head 
and watched it until it was a tiny 
pinpoint of light that was fleeing 
spaceward. 

He lifted a hand hesitantly, half 
doubting the fitness of a parting 
gesture. 

"Good-by, Ash,” he said un- 
derneath his breath. "Good-by, 
Ash. God bless you, Eva.” 

Standing there, he had a. hope- 
ful thought. 

Perhaps, he told himself, Sutton 
never will learn she is an android 
woman. But he knew then that 
Eva would tell the truth and that 
it would hot change Sutton’s love 
for her.
