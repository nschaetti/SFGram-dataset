What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 



CVERY important discovery relating 
•*-* to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to 6elf- 
advancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and suc- 
cessful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature’s laws, accumulat- 
ed through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from im - : ' dons 
men in high places, but never destmyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of 1% of the earth’s 
people were thought capable of receiv- 
ing basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which “whispers” to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak- 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleep- 
ing. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
inter, sting truths. You can start at once 
to i .I.' n your inner powers of self- 
on 1 i t iding and self-advancement. 
You ..m learn from one of the world’s 
oldest 1 1 r titutions, first known in Amer- 
ica in 1<>94. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosi- 
crucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the “Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the ini- 
tials “AMORC.” The teachings of the 
Order are not 6old, for it is not a com- 
mercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, “The Mastery of Life.” 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe

What's The Good Word ? 



TN discussing Mario Pei’s stimu- 
lating The Story of English 
(Lippincott), I mentioned briefly 
the vexing problem of the science 
fiction writer in foreguessing fu- 
ture language. 

It can’t be ignored, of course; 
objects and methods must be 
named so the reader will recog- 
nize them. All the author can do 
is apply logic, which sometimes 
works, as in the case of several 
commonly used terms invented 
by science fiction, but more often 
does not, as in terms that are 
born naturally, not synthesized. 

The annoying difficulty can be 
followed closely in World Pub- 
lishing Company’s Webster’s New 
World Dictionary of the Ameri- 
can Language. 

Unlike almost all other dic- 
tionaries, this one is a record of 
the words and phrases that you 
and I have helped to popularize 
rather than, as Ambrose Bierce 
defined such books: “A malevo- 
lent literary device for cramping 
the growth of a language and 
making it hard and inelastic.” 

Dictionaries don’t determine 
“good” usage; people do. If that 
weren’t so, we’d still be using 
the words listed in 1499 by Wyn- 
kyn de Worde’s Promptorum 
Parvulorum sive clericorum, 
which, despite its Latin title, was 



the first dictionary to be printed 
on English soil. 

Let’s take a few examples from 
this New World Dictionary and 
see how language grows. 

Television, TV and video are 
now established. TV first was 
used in 1907 in a magazine called 
The World Today, but engineers 
used distant electric vision, a 
cumbersome term that couldn’t 
compete with science fiction’s 
name for the device. 

Jeep, nylon, kleenex and cello- 
phane have invaded so many 
languages that nylon signifies 
“superfine” in Turkey and 
Greece, and Communist Hungary 
has banned jeep and nylon as de- 
cadent capitalistic word-inven- 
tions. 

Jeep was coined by soldiers 
during World War II from the 
frigid military designation of the 
vehicle, “General Purpose Car,” 
which naturally was abbreviated 
to “G.P.” in stock lists. Using 
only logic, you’d expect it to be 
called jeepie, and perhaps it 
would have if the Wacs (another 
fortuitous military invention) had 
named the machine. 

There is nothing snide in that 
comment, for sex has a lot to do 
with the devising of words. Wo- 
men, or those who sell to them, 
created panties, scanties and 



2 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




nighties, while male merchandis- 
ing is designed to make even the 
puniest man feel outdoorsy. 

The armed services here and in 
England finally recognised the 
importance, of initials, hence: 
Wrens and Waves. Amgot had to 
be shortened to A.M.G. because 
it was banned as a censorable 
word in Turkey. 

Nylon and kleenex are trade 
names, born at the conference 
table, which gave us such valu- 
able additions as sudsy, deep- 
down goodness and LS/MFT. 
(The process, known as spitball- 
ing in advertising, meaning to 
offer suggestions, was omitted, 
but should be included.) 

Cellophane more classically is 
derived from cella, small room, 
plus phanein, to appear, seem— 
not too unlikely an invention for 
a writer, but he’d have had no 
chance to anticipate the others. 

One argument I don’t expect to 
be resolved quickly is the spelling 
of hassel vs. hassle, the first pre- 
ferred by the New World and the 
second by the New Century. New 
World defines it as a heated dis- 
cussion, squabble. 

I accept New World’s spelling 
in entirety, the definition in part, 
and the etymology not at all. 

The popular meaning is any 
frantic activity, usually although 
not always verbal, resulting in 
purposeless confusion and frus- 
tration. 



There should be no “?” in giv- 
ing its origin. Radio Row, which 
should know, accredits it to Joe 
Hassel, a sportscaster notable for 
his excitability. ( Newscaster got 
into the New World, but sports- 
caster for some reason didn’t.) 

So, like boycott, derrick, mae 
west and spoonerism, hassel is, 
as the French would put it, the 
name of a nartie. Even if a science 
fiction writer of the past had 
known they would be, he might 
just as legitimately have chosen 
cosgrove, manischewitz, dolly 
dawn or smithism . 

More troublesome, though, is 
deciding which slang terms will 
endure, which will enter the lan- 
guage as full citizens, and which 
will be the future equivalent of 
odds bodkins or the bee’s knees. 
• Ain’t, for example, is properly 
included in the New World — the 
first time, as far as I know, with- 
out being snooted (Middle Eng- 
lish, snute, snout). 

And Mark Twain is our au- 
thority for creative etymology. 
He proved that Middletown was 
named after Moses by dropping 
-oses and adding -iddletown. 

If we were trying to predict 
instead of entertain, you’d be 
right in objecting to our inevi- 
table bloopers (origin unknown). 
But would you rather wait for 
the correct lingo ( lingua , tongue) 
or enjoy our guessing right now?

WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

the touch of your hand 



By THEODORE STURGEON 

Osser knew exactly what he wanted, why he 
wanted it, and how to get it— except that 
t each one of his reasons was totally wrong! 



IG there,” said Osser, 
pointing. 

The black-browed 
man pulled back. “Why?” 

“We must dig deep to build 
high, and we are going to build 
high.” 

“Why?” the man asked again. 
“To keep the enemy out.” 
“There are no enemies.” 

Osser laughed bitterly. “I’ll 
have enemies.” 

“Why?” 

Osser came to him. “Because 



I’m going to pick up this village 
and shake it until it wakes up. 
And if it won’t wake up, I’ll keep 
shaking until I break its back 
and it dies. Dig.” 

“I don’t see why,” said the man 
doggedly. 

Osser looked at the golden 
backs of his hands, turned them 
over, watched them closing. He 
raised his eyes to the other. 

“This is why,” he said. 

His right fist tore the man’s 
cheek. His left turned the man’s

breath to a bullet which exploded 
as it left him. He huddled on the 
ground, unable to exhale, inhal- 
ing in small, heavy, tearing sobs. 
His eyes opened and he looked 
up at Osser. He could not speak, 
but his eyes did; and through 
shock and pain all they said was 
“Why?” 

“"VTOU want reasons,” OsSer 
said, when he felt the man 
could hear him. “You want rea- 
sons — all of you. You see both 
sides of every question and you 
weigh and balance and cancel 
yourselves out. I want an end to 
reason. I want things done.” 

He bent to lift the bearded 
man to his feet. Osser stood half 
a head taller and his shoulders 
were as full and smooth as the 
bottoms of bowls. Golden hairs 
shifted and glinted on his fore- 
arms as he moved his fingers and 
the great cords tensed and val- 
leyed. He lifted the man clear of 
the ground and set him easily on 
his feet and held him until he' 
was sure of his balance. 

“You don’t understand me, do 
you?” 

The man shook his head weak- 
ly- 

“Don’t try. You’ll dig more if 
you don’t try.” He clapped the 
handle of the shovel into the 
man’s hand and picked up a mat- 
tock. “Dig,” he said, and the 
man began to dig. 



Osser smiled when the man 
turned to work, arched his nos- 
trils and drew the warm clean 
air into his lungs. He liked the 
sunlight now, the morning smell 
of the turned soil, the work he 
had to do and the idea itself of 
working. 

Standing so, with his head 
raised, he saw a hash of bright 
yellow, the turn of a tanned face. 
Just a glimpse, and she was gone. 

For a moment he tensed, 
frowning. If she had seen him, 
she would be off to clatter the 
story of it to the whole village. 
Then he smiled. Let her. Let 
them all know. They must, sooner 
or later. Let them try to stop 
him. 

He laughed, gripped his mat- 
tock, and the sod flew. So Jubilith 
saw fit to watch him, did she? 

He laughed again. Work now, 
Juby later. In time he would 
have everything. 

Everything. 

HHHE village street wound and 
wandered and from time to 
time divided and rejoined itself, 
for each house was built on a 
man’s whim — near, far, high, 
small, separate, turned to or 
away. What did not harmonize 
contrasted well, and over all it 
was a pleasing place to walk. 

Before a shop a wood-cobbler 
sat, gouging out sabots; and he 
was next door to the old leather- 



6 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




worker who cunningly wove im- 
mortal belts of square-knotted 
rawhide. Then a house, and an- 
other, and a cabin; a space of 
green where children played; and 
the skeleton of a new building 
where a man, his apron pockets 
full of hardwood pegs, worked 
knowledgably with a heavy mal- 
let. 

The cobbler, 'the leatherworker, 
the children and the builder all 
stopped to watch Jubilith be- 
cause she was beautiful and be- 
cause she ran. When she was by, 
they each saw the others watch- 
ing, and each smiled and waved 
and laughed a little, though noth- 
ing was said. 

A puppy lolloped along after 
her, three legs deft, the fourth in 
the way. Had it been frightened, 
it would not have run, and had 
Jubilith spoken to it, it would 
have followed wherever she went. 
But she ignored it, even when it 
barked its small soprano bark, 
so it curved away from her, pre- 
tending it had been going Some- 
where else anyway, and then it 
sat and puffed and looked after 
her sadly. 

Past the smithy with its shad- 
owed, glowing heart she ran; past 
the gristmill with its wonderful 
wheel, taking and yielding with 
its heavy cupped hands. A boy 
struck his hoop and it rolled 
across her path. Without break- 
ing stride, she leaped high over 



it and ran on, and the glass- 
blower’s lips burst away from his 
pipe, for a man can smile or 
blow glass, but not both at the 
same time. 

When at last she reached 
Wrenn’s house, she was breath- 
ing deeply, but with no difficulty, 
in the way possible only to those 
who run beautifully. She stopped 
by the open door and waited po- 
litely, not looking in until Pyva 
came out and touched her shoul- 
der. 

J UBILITH faced her, keeping 
her eyes closed for a long mo- 
ment, for Oyva was not only 
very old, she was Wrenn’s wife. 

“Is it Jubilith?” asked Oyva, 
smiling. 

“It is,” said the girl. She opened 
her eyes. 

Oyva, seeing their taut corn- 
ers, said shrewdly, “A troubled 
Jubilith as well. I’ll not keep you. 
He’s just inside.” 

Juby found a swift flash of 
smile to give her and went into 
the house, leaving the old woman 
to wonder where, where in her 
long life she had seen such a brief 
flash of such great loveliness. A 
firebird’s wing? A green meteor? 
She put it away in her mind next 
to the memory of a burst of 
laughter — Wrenn’s, just after he 
had kissed her first — and sat 
down on a three-legged stool by 
the side of the house. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



7 




A HEAVY fiber screen had 
-**■ been set up inside the door- 
way, to form a sort of meander, 
and at the third turn it was very 
dark. Juby paused to let the sun- 
light drain away from her vision. 
Somewhere in the dark before her 
there was music, the hay-clean 
smell of flower petals dried and 
freshly rubbed, and a voice hum- 
ming. The voice and the music 
were open and free, but choked a 
listener’s throat like the sudden 
appearance of a field of daffodils. 

The voice and the music 
stopped short, and someone 
breathed quietly in the darkness. 

“Is ... is it Wrenn?” she 
faltered. 

“It is,” said the voice. 

“Jubilith here.” 

“Move the screen,” said the 
voice. “I’d like the light, talking 
to you, Jubilith.” 

She felt behind her, touched 
the screen. It had many hinges 
and swung easily away to the 
doorside. Wrenn sat crosslegged 
in the corner behind a frame 
which held a glittering complex 
of stones. 

He brushed petal-dust from his 
hands. “Sit there, child, and tell 
me what it is you do not under- 
stand.” 

She sat down befpre him and 
lowered her eyes, and his wid- 
ened, as if someone had taken 
away a great light. 

When she had nothing to say, 



he prompted her gently: “See if 
you can put it all into a single 
word, Jubilith.” 

She said immediately, “Osser.” 
“Ah,” said Wrenn. 

“I followed him this morning, 
out to the foothills beyond the 
Sky-tree Grove. He — ” 

Wrenn waited. 

Jubilith put up her small 
hands, clenched, and talked in a 
rush. “Sussten, with the black 
brows, he was with Osser. They 
stopped and Osser shouted at 
him, and, when I came to where 
I could look down and see them, 
Osser took his fists and hammered 
Sussten, knocked him down. He 
laughed and picked him up. Sus- 
sten was sick; he was shaken and 
there was blood on his face. 
Osser told him to dig, and Sus- 
sten dug, Osser laughed again, he 
laughed ... I think he saw me. 
I came here.” 

Slowly she put her fists down. 
Wrenn said nothing, 

Jubilith said, in a voice like a 
puzzled sigh, “I understand this: 
when a man hammers something, 
iron or clay or wood, it is to 
change what he hammers from 
what it is to what he wishes it 
to be.” She raised one hand, 
made a fist, and put it down 
again. She shook her head slight- 
ly and her heavy soft hair moved 
on her back. “To hammer a man 
is to change nothing. Sussten re- 
mains Sussten.”

“It was good to tell me of 
this,” said Wrenn when he was 
sure she had finished. 

“Not good,” Jubilith disclaim- 
ed. “I want to understand.” 

RENN shook his head. Juby 
cocked her head on one side 
like a wondering bright bird. 
When she realized that his ges- 
ture was a refusal, a small paired 
crease' came and went between 
her brows. 

"May I not understand this?” 

“You must not understand it,” 
Wrenn corrected. “Not yet, any- 
way. Perhaps after a time. Per- 
haps never.” 

“Oh,” she said. “I — I didn’t 
know.” 

“How could you know?” he 
asked kindly. “Don’t follow Osser 
again, Jubilith.” 

She parted her lips, then again 
gave the small headshake. She 
rose and went out. 1 ' 

Oyva came to her. “Better now, 
Jubilith?” 

Juby turned her head away; 
then, realizing that this was ill- 
mannered, met Oyva’s gaze. The 
girl’s eyes were full of tears. She 
closed them respectfully. Oyva 
touched her shoulder and let her 
89 - 

Watching the slim, bright fig- 
ure trudge away, bowed with 
thought, drag-footed, unseeing, 
Oyva grunted and stumped into 
the house. 



“Did she have to be hurt?” she 
demanded. 

“She did,” said Wrenn gently. 
“Osser,” he added. 

“Ah,” she said, in just the tone 
he had used when Jubilith first 
mentioned the name. “What has 
he done now?” 

Wrenn told her. Oyva sucked 
her lips in thoughtfully. “Why 
was the girl following him?” 

“I didn’t ask her. But don’t 
you know?” 

“I suppose I do,” said Oyva, 
and sighed. “That mustn’t hap- 
pen, Wrenn.” 

“It won’t. I told her not to 
follow him again.” 

She looked at him fondly. “I 
suppose even you can act like a 
fool once in a while.” 

He was startled. “Fool?” 

“She loves him. You won’t 
keep her from him by a word of 
advice.” 

“You judge her by yourself,” 
he said, just as fondly. “She’s 
only a child. In a day, a week, 
she’ll wrap someone else up in her 
dreams.” 

“Suppose she doesn’t?” 

“Don’t even think about it.” A 
shudder touched his voice. 

“I shall, though,” said Oyva 
with determination. “And you’d 
do well to think about it, too.” 
When his eyes grew troubled, she 
touched his cheek gently. “Now 
play some more for me.” 

He sat down before the instru- 




THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND

ment, his hands poised. Then into 
the tiny bins his fingers went, 
rubbing this dried-petal powder 
and that, and the stone's glowed, 
changing the flower-scents into 
music and shifting colors. 

He began to sing softly to the 
music. 

rriHEY dug deep, day by day, 
-*• and they built. Osser did the 
work of three men, and some- 
times six or eight others worked 
with him, and sometimes one or 
two. Once he had twelve. But 
never did he work alone. 

When the stone was three tiers 
above ground level, Osser climbed 
the nearest rise and stood looking 
down at it proudly, at the thick- ! 
ness and strength of the growing 
walls, at the toiling workers who 
lifted and strained to make them 
grow. 

“Is it Osser?” 

The voice was as faint and shy 
as a fern uncurling, as promising 
as spring itself. 

He turned. 

“Jubilith, • 7 ’ she told him. 

“What are you doing here?” 

“I come here every day,” she 
said. She indicated the copse 
which crowned the hill. “I hide 
here and watch you.” 

“What do you want?” 

She laced her fingers. “I would 
like to dig there and lift stones.” 

“No,” he said, and turned to 
study the work again. 



“Why not?” 

“Never ask me why. ‘Because 
I say so’ — that’s all the answer 
you’ll get from me — you or any- 
one.” 

She came to stand beside him. 
“You build fast.” 

He nodded. “Faster than any 
village house was ever built.” He 
could sense the ‘why’ rising with- 
in her, and could feel it being 
checked. » 

“I want to build it, too,” she 
pleaded. 

“No,” he said. His eyes wid- 
ened as he watched the work. 
Suddenly he was gone, leaping 
down the slope in great springy 
strides. He turned the corner of 
the new wall and stood, saying 
nothing. The man who had been 
idling turned quickly and lifted a 
stone. Osser smiled a quick, taut 
smile and went to work beside 
him. Jubilith stood on the slope, 
watching, wondering. 

She came almost every day as 
the tower grew. Osser never spoke 
to her. She watched the sunlight 
on him, the lithe strength, the 
rippling gold. He stood like a 
great tree, squatted like a rock, 
moved like a thundercloud. His 
voice was a whip, a bugle, the 
roar of a bull. 

She saw him less and less in 
the village. Once it was a fear- 
some thing to see. Early in the 
morning he appeared suddenly, 
overtook a man? lifted him and

threw him flat on the ground. 

“I told you to be out thefe 
yesterday,” he growled, and 
strode away. 

Friends came and picked the 
man up, held him softly while 
he coughed, took him away to be 
healed. 

No one went to Wrenn about 
it; the word had gone around 
that Osser and his affairs were 
not to be understood. Most things 
could be understood by anyone. 
Wrenn’s function was to explain 
those few things which could not 
be understood. But certain of 
these few were not to be under- 
stood at all. So Osser was left 
alone to do as he wished — which 
was a liberty, after all, that was 
enjoyed by everyone else. 

HpWILIGHT came when Jubi- 
lith waited past her usual 
time. She waited until by ones 
and twos the workers left the 
tower, until Osser himself had 
climbed the hill, until he had 
paused to look back and be proud 
and think of tomorrow’s work, 
until he, too, had turned his face 
to the town. Then she slipped 
down to the tower and around it, 
and carefully climbed the scaf- 
folding on the far side. She looked < 
about her. 

The tower was now four stories 
high and seemed to be shaping 
toward a roof. Circular in cross- 
section, the tower had two rooms 



on each floor, an east-west wall 
between them on the ground floor, 
a north-south wall on the next, 
and so on up. 

, There was a central well into 
which was built a spiral staircase 
— a double spiral, as if one helix 
had been screwed into the other. 
This made possible two exits to 
stairs on each floor at the same 
level, though they were walled 
off one from the other. Each of 
the two rooms on every floor had 
one connecting doorway. -Each 
room had three windows in it, 
wide on the inside, tapering 
through the thick stone wall to 
form the barest slit outside. 

A portion of the castellated 
roof was already built. It over- 
hung the entrance, and had slots 
in the overhang through which 
the whole entrance face of the 
tower could be covered by one 
man lying unseen on the roof, 
looking straight down. 

Stones lay in a trough ready 
for placing, and there was some 
leftover mortar in the box. Jubi- 
lith picked up a trowel and 
worked it experimentally in the 
stuff, then lifted some out and 
tipped it down on the unfinished 
top of the wall, just as she had 
seen Osser do so many times. She 
put down the trowel and chose a 
stone. It was heavy — much heav- 
ier than she had expected — but 
she made it move, made it lift, 
made it seat itself to suit her on 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND

the fresh mortar. She ticked off 
the excess from the join and 
stepped back to admire it in the 
fading light. 

Two great clamps, hard as 
teeth, strong as a hurricane, 
caught her right thigh and her 
left armpit. She was swung into 
the air and held helpless over the 
unfinished parapet. 

She was utterly silent, shocked 
past the ability even to gasp. 

“I told you you were not to 
work here,” said Osser between 
his teeth. So tall he was, so long 
were his arms as he held her 
high over his head, that it seemed 
almost as far to the parapet as it 
was to the ground below. 

He leaned close to the edge and _ 
shook her. “I’ll throw you off. 
This tower is mine to build, you 
hear?” 

If she had been able to breathe, 
she might have screamed or 
pleaded with him. If she had 
screamed or pleaded, he might 
have dropped her. But her silence 
apparently surprised him. He 
grunted and set her roughly on 
her feet. She caught at his shoul- 
der to keep her balance, then 
quickly transferred her hold to 
the edge of the parapet. She 
dropped her head between her 
upper arms. Her long soft hair 
fell forward over her face, and 
she moaned. 

“I told you,” he said, really 
seeing her at last. His voice shook. 



He stepped toward her and put 
out his hand. She screamed. “Be 
quiet !” he roared. A moan shut 
off in mid-breath. “Ah, I told 
you, Juby. You shouldn’t have 
tried to build here.” 

He ran his great hands over the 
edge of the stonework, found the 
one she had laid, the one that had 
cost her such effort to lift. With 
dne hand, he plucked it up and 
threw it far out into the shadows 
below. * 

“I wanted to help you with it,” 
she whispered. 

“Don’t you understand?” he 
cried. “No one builds here who 
wants to help!” 

S HE simply shook her head. 

She tried to breathe deeply 
and a long shudder possessed her. 
When it passed, she turned weak- 
ly and stood, her back partly 
arched over the edge of the para- 
pet, her hands behind her to 
cushion the stone. She shook the 
hair out of her face; it fell away 
on either side like a dawnlit bow- 
wave. She looked up at him with 
an expression of such piteous con- 
fusion that .his dwindling rage 
vanished altogether. 

He dropped his eyes and 
shuffled one foot like a guilty 
child. “Juby, leave me alone.” 
Something almost like a smile 
touched her lips. She brushed her 
bruised arm, then walked past 
him to the place where the scaf-

folding projected above the para- 
!>et. 

“Not that way,” he called. 
"Come here.” 

He took her hand and led her 
to the spiral staircase at the 
center of the tower. It was almost 
totally dark inside. It seemed like 
an age to her as they descended; 
she was alone in a black uni- 
verse consisting of a rhythmic 
drop and turn, and a warm hard 
hand in hers, holding and leading 
her. 

When they emerged, he stopped 
in the strange twilight, a dark- 
ness for all the world but a dazzle 
to them, so soaked with blackness 
were their eyes. She tugged gent- 
ly, but he would not release her 
hand. She moved close to see his 
face. His eyes were wide and 
turned unseeing to the far slopes; 
he was frowning, yet his mouth 
was not fierce, but irresolute. 
Whatever his inward struggle 
was, it left his face gradually 
and transferred itself to his hand. 
Its pressure on hers became firm, 
hard, intense, painful. 

“Osser!” 

He dropped the hand and 
stepped back, shamed. “Juby, I 
will take you to . Juby, do you 
want to understand?” He waved 
at the tower. 

She said, “Oh, yes!” 

He looked at her closely, and 
the angry, troubled diffidence 
came and went. “Half a day 



there, half a day back again,” he 
said. 

She recognized that this was as 
near as this feral, unhappy man 
could come to asking a permis- 
sion. “I’d like to understand,” 
she said. 

“If you don’t, I’m going to 
kill you,” he blurted. He turned 
to the west and strode off, not 
looking back. 

Jubilith watched him go, and 
suddenly there was a sparkle in 
her wide eyes. She slipped out of 
her sandals, caught them up in 
her hand, and ran lightly and 
silently after him. He planted his- 
feet strongly, like the sure, power- 
ful teeth of the millwheel gears, 
and he would not look back. She 
sensed how immensely important 
it was to him not to look back*. 
She knew that right-handed men 
look back over their left shoul- 
ders, so she drifted along close to 
him, a little behind him, a little to 
his right. How long, how long, 
until he looked to see if she was 
coming? 

U P and up the slope, to its 
crest, over . down ... ah! 
Just here, just at the last second 
where he could turn and look 
without stopping and still catch 
a glimpse of the tower’s base, 
where they had stood. So he 
turned, and she passed around 
him like a windblown feather, 
unseen. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



13 




And he stopped, looking back, 
craning. His shoulders slumped, 




and slowly he turned to his path 
« again — and there was Jubilith be- 
fore him. 

She laughed. 

His jaw dropped, and then his 
lips came together in a thin, 
. angry seal. For a moment he 
stared at her; and suddenly, 
quite against his will, there burst 
from him a single harsh bark of 
laughter. She put out her hand 
and he came to her, took it, and 
they went their way together. 

They came to a village when 
it was very late and very dark, 
and Osser circled it. They came 
to another, and Jubilith thought 
he would do the same, for he 
turned south; but when they 



came abreast of it, he struck 
north again. 

“We’ll be seen/’ he explained 
gruffly, “but we’ll be seen com- 
ing from the south and leaving 
northward.” 

She would not ask where he 
was taking her, or why he was 
making these elaborate arrange- 
ments, but already she had an 
idea. What lay to the west was — 
not forbidden, exactly, but, say 
discouraged. It was felt that there 
was nothing in that country that 
could be of value. Anyone travel- 
ing that way would surely be re- 
membered. 

So through the village they 
went, and they dined quickly at 
an inn, and went northward, and 
once in the darkness, veered west 



again. In a wood so dark that she 
had taken his hand again, he 
stopped and built a fire. He threw 
down springy boughs and a thick 
heap of ferns, and this was her 
bed. He slept sitting up, his back 
to a tree trunk, with Jubilith be- 
tween him and the fire. 

Jubilith awoke twice during 
the long night, once to see him 
with his eyes closed, but feeling 
that he was not asleep; and once 
to see him with his eyes open and 
the dying flames flickering in the 
pupils, and she thought then that 
he was asleep, or at least not 
with her, but lost in the pictures 
the flames painted. 

In the morning they moved on, 
gathering berries for breakfast, 
washing in a humorous brook. 




THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



15 



And during this whole journey, 
nothing passed between them but 
the small necessary phrases: 
“You go first here.” “Look out — 
it drops.” “Tired yet?” 

For there was that about Jubi- 
lith which made explanations un- 
necessary. Though she did not 
know where they were going, or 
why, she understood what must 
be done to get them there within 
the framework of his desire: to 
go immediately, as quickly as 
possible, undetected by anyone 
else. 

She did only what she could 
to help and did not plague him 
with questions which would cer- 
tainly be answered in good time. 
So: “Here are berries.” “Look, a 
red bird!” “Can we get through 
there, or shall we go around?” 
And nothing more. 

fT^HEY did well, the weather 
was fine, and by mid-morning 
they had reached the tumbled 
country of the Crooked Hills. 
Jubilith had seen them from afar 
— great broken mounds and 
masses against the western sky — 
but no one ever went there, and 
she knew nothing about them. 

They were in open land now, 
and Jubilith regretted leaving the 
color and aliveness of the forest. 
The grasses here were strange, 
like yet unlike those near her 
village. They were taller, sickly, 
and some had odd ugly flowers. 



There were bald places, scored 
with ancient rain-gullies, as if 
some mighty hand had dashed 
acid against the soil. There were 
few insects and no animals that 
she could see, and no birds sang. 
It was a place of great sadness 
rather than terror; there was 
little to fear, but much to grieve 
for. 

By noon, they faced a huge 
curved ridge, covered with brok- 
en stones. It looked as if the 
land itself had reared up and 
pressed back from a hidden some- 
thing on the other side — some- 
thing which it would not touch. 
Osser quickened their pace as 
they began to climb, although 
the going was hard. Jubilith rea- 
lized that they were near the 
end of their journey, and un- 
complainingly struggled along at 
the cruel pace he set. 

At the top, they paused, giving 
their first attention to their wind, 
and gradually to the scene before 
them. 

The ridge on which they stood 
was nearly circular, and perhaps 
a mile and a half in diameter. 
In its center was a small round 
lake with unnaturally bare shores. 
Mounds of rubble sloped down 
toward it on all sides, and farther 
back was broken stone. 

But it was the next zone which 
caught and held the eye. The 
weed-grown wreckage there was 
beyond description. Great twisted 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




' b« and ribs of gleaming metal 
■ve in and out of the slumped 
ups of soil and masonry, 
•firby, a half-acre of laminated 
i ' stood on edge like a dinner- 
it< in a clay bank. What could 
• vc been a building taller than 
n iy Jubilith had ever heard about 
f i y on its side, smashed and bulg- 

mg. 

Gradually she began to rea- 
lize the peculiarity of this place — 
All the larger wreckage lay in 
lines directly to and from the 
lake in a monstrous radiation of 
ruin. 

“What is this place?” she asked 
at last. 

“Don’t know,” he grunted, and 
went over the edge to skip down 
the steep slope. When she caught 
up with him near the bottom, he 
said, “There’s miles of this, west 
and north of here, much bigger. 
But this is the one we came to 
see. Come.” 

He looked to right and left as 
if to get his bearings, then 
plunged into the tough and 
scrubby underbrush that vainly 
tried to cover those tortured 
metal bones. She followed as 
closely as she could, beating at 
the branches which he carelessly 
let whip back. 

Just in front of her, he turned 
the corner of a sharp block of 
stone, and when she turned it no 
more than a second later, he was 
gone. 



S HE stopped, turned, turned 
again. Dust, weeds, lonely and 
sorrowful ruins. No Osser. She 
shrank back against the stone, 
her eyes wide. 

The bushes nearby trembled, 
then lashed. Osser’s head emerg- 
ed. “What’s the matter? Come 
on!” he said gruffly. 

She checked an impulse to cry 
out and run to him, and came 
silently forward. Osser held the 
bushes briefly, and beside him she 
saw a black hole with broken 
steps leading downward. 

She hesitated, but he moved 
his head impatiently, and she 
passed him and led the way 
downward. When he followed, his 
wide flat body blocked out the 
light. The darkness was so heavy; 
her eyes ached. 

He prodded her in the small of 
the back. “Go on, go on!” 

The foot of the steps came 
sooner than she expected and her 
knees buckled as she took the 
downward step that was not 
there. She tripped, almost fell, 
then somehow got to the side 
wall and braced herself there, 
trembling. 

“Wait,” he said, and the ir- 
repressible smile quirked the cor- 
ners of her mouth. As if sbe would 
go anywhere! . 

She heard him fumbling about 
somewhere, and then there was 
a sudden aching blaze of light 
that made her cry out and clap 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



17 



her hands over her face. 

“Look,” he said. “I want you 
to look at this. Hold it.” 

Info her hands he pressed a 
cylinder about half the length of 
her forearm. At one end was a 
lens from which the blue-white 
light was streaming. 

“See this little thing here,” he 
said, and touched a stud at the 
side of the cylinder. The light 
disappeared, came on again. 

She laughed delightedly, took 
the cylinder and played its light 
around, switching it on and off, 
“It’s wonderful!” she cried. “Oh, 
wonderful!” 

“You take this one,” he said, 
pleased. He handed her another 
torch and took the first from 
her. “It isn’t as good, but it will 
help. I’ll go first.” 

She took the second torch and 
tried it. It worked the same way, 
but the light was orange and 
feeble. Osser strode ahead down 
a slanting passageway. At first 
there was a great deal of rubble 
underfoot, but soon the way was 
clear as they went farther and 
deeper. Osser walked with con- 
fidence, and she knew he had 
been here before, probably many 
times. 

“Here,” he said, stopping to 
wait for her. His voice echoed 
strangely, vibrant with controlled 
excitement. 

He turned his torch ahead, 
swept it back and forth. 



They were at the entrance to 
a room. It was three times the 
height of a man, and as big as 
their village green. She stared 
around, awed. 

“Come,” Osser said again, and 
went to the far corner. 

A massive, boxlike object* stood 
there. One panel, about eye-level, 
was of a milky smooth substance, 
the rest of black metal. Project- 
ing from the floor in front of it 
was a lever. Osser grasped it 
confidently and pulled. It yielded 
sluggishly, and returned to its 
original position. Osser tugged 
again. There was a low growling 
sound from the box. Osser pulled, 
released, pulled, released, each 
time a little faster. The sound 
rose in pitch, higher and higher. 

“Turn off your light,” he said. 

She did so and blackness snap- 
ped in around them. As the daz- 
zle faded from her eyes, she 
detected a flicker of silver light 
before her, and realized that it 
came from the milky pane in the 
box. As Osser pulled at the lever 
and the whine rose and rose in 
pitch, the square got bright 
enough for her to see her hands 
when she looked down at them. 

And then — the pictures. 

J UBILITH had never seen pic- 
tures like these. They moved, 
for one thing; for another, they 
had no color. Everything in them 
was black and white and shades 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




<*f gray. Yet everything they 
i lowed seemed very real. 

Not at first, for there was flick- 
mi ng and stopped motion, and 
ri f-n slow motion as Osser’s lever 
i oved faster and faster. But at 
i ;t the picture steadied, and 
•ser kept the lever going at the 
me speed, flicking it with ap- 
parent ease about twice a second, 
iiile the whine inside the box 
vttled to a steady, soft moan. 

The picture showed a ball spin- 
ning against a black, light-flecked 
■ urtain. It rushed close until it 
tilled the screen, and still closer, 
and Jubilith suddenly had the 
feeling that she was falling at 
tremendous velocity from an un- 
thinkable height. Down and down 
the scene went, until at last the 
surface began to take on the 
qualities of a bird’s-eye view. 
She saw a river and lakes, and a 
great range of hills — 

And, at last, the city. 

It was a city beyond fantasy, 
greater and more elaborate than 
imagination could cope with. Its 
towers stretched skyward to 
pierce the clouds themselves — 
some actually did. It had wide 
ramps on which traffic crawled, 
great bridges across the river, 
parks over which the buildings 
hung like mighty cliffs. Closer 
still the silver eye came to the 
scene, and she realized that the 
traffic was not crawling, but mov- 
ing faster than a bird, faster than 



the wind. The vehicles were low 
and sleek and efficient. 

And on the walks were people, 
and the scene wheeled and slow- 
ed and showed them. They were 
elaborately clothed and well-fed; 
they were hurried and orderly at 
the same time. There was a square 
in which perhaps a thousand of 
them, all dressed alike, were 
drawn up in lines as straight as 
stretched string. Even as she 
watched, they all began to move 
together, a thousand left legs 
coming forward, a thousand right 
arms swinging back. 

Higher, then, and more, of the 
city — more and more of it, until 
the sense of wonder filled her 
lungs and she hardly breathed; 
and still more of it, miles of it. 
And at last a great open space 
with what looked like sections of 
road crossing on it — but such 
unthinkable roads! Each was as 
wide as her whole village and 
miles long. And on these roads, 
great birdlike machines tilted 
down and touched and rolled, 
and swung and ran and took the 
air, dozens of them every minute. 
The scene swept close again, and 
it was as if she were in such a 
machine herself; but it did not 
land. It raced past the huge busy 
crossroads and out to a coastline. 

And there were ships, ships as 
long as the tallest buildings were 
high, and clusters, dozens, hun- 
dreds of other vessels working 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



19 




and smoking and milling about 
in the gray water. Huge machines 
crouched over ships and lifted 
out cargoes; small, agile machines 
scurried about the docks and 
warehouses. 

Then at last the scene dwindled 
as the magic eye rose higher and 
higher, faster and faster. Details 
disappeared, and clouds raced 
past and downward, and at last 
the scene was a disc and then a 
ball floating in starlit space. 

/~\SSER let the lever go and it 
” snapped back to its original 
position. The moan descended 
quickly in pitch, and the motion 
on the screen slowed, flickered, 
faded and went out. 

Jubilith let the darkness come. 
Her mind spun and shook with 
the impact of what she had seen. 
Slowly she recovered herself. She 
became conscious of Osser’s hard 
breathing. She turned on her dim 
orange torch and looked at him. 
He was watching her. 

“What was it?” she breathed. 

“What I came to show you.” 

She thought hard. She thought 
about his tower, about his refusal 
to let her work on it, about his 
cruelty to those who had. She 
looked at him, at the blank 
screen. And this was to supply 
the reason. 

She shook her head. 

He lowered himself slowly and 
squatted like an animal, hunched 



up tight, his knees in his armpits. 
This lifted and crooked his heavy 
arms. He rested their knuckles on 
the floor. He glowered at her and 
said nothing. He was waiting. 

On the way here, he had said, 
“I’ll kill you if you don’t under- 
stand.” But he wouldn’t really, 
would he? Would he? 

If he had towered over her, 
ranted and shouted, she would 
not have been afraid. But squat- 
ting there, waiting, silent, with 
his great arms bowed out like 
that, he was like some patient, 
preying beast. 

She .turned off the light to blot 
out the sight of him, and im- 
mediately became speechless with 
terror at the idea of his sitting 
there in the dark so close, wait- 
ing. She might run; she was so 
swift . but no; crouched like 
that, he could spring and catch 
her before she could tense a 
muscle. 

Again she looked at the dead 
screen. “Wiil you . tell me 
something?” she quavered. 

“I might.” 

“Tell me, then: When you first 
saw that picture, did you under- 
stand? The very first time?” 

His expression did not change. 
But slowly he relaxed. He rocked 
sidewise, sat down, extended his 
legs. He was man again, not mon- 
ster. She shuddered, then con- 
trolled it. 

He said, “It took me a long 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




' i me and many visits. I should 
not have asked you to understand 
at once.” 

She again accepted the timid 
half -step toward an apology, and 
was grateful. 

He said, “Those were men and 
I women just like us. Did you see 
r that? Just like us.” 

“Their clothes — ” 

“Just like us,” he insisted. “Of 
course they dressed differently, 
lived differently! In a world like 
that, why not? Ah, how they 
built, how they built!” 

“Yes,” she whispered. Those 
towers, the shining, swift vehicles, 
the thousand who moved like 
one . “Who were they?” she 
asked him. 

“Don’t you know? Think — 
think!” 

“Osser, I want to understand. 
I truly want to!” 

OHE hunted frantically for the 
right thing to say, the right 
way to catch at this elusive thing 
which was so frighteningly im- 
portant to him. All her life she 
had had the answers to the ques- 
tions she wanted to understand. 
All she had ever had to do was to 
close her eyes and think of the 
problem, and the answers soon 
came. 

But not this problem. 

“Osser,” she pleaded, “where 
is it, the city, the great compli- 
cated city?” 



“Say, ‘Where was it?’ ” he 
growled. 

She caught his thought and 
gasped. “This?' These ruins, Os- 
ser?” 

“Ah,” he said approvingly. “It 
comes slowly, doesn’t it? No, 
Juby. Not here. What was here 
was an outpost, a village, com- 
pared with the big city. North 
and west, I told you, didn’t I? 
Miles of it. So big that ... so 
big — ” He extended his arms, 
dropped them helplessly. Sud- 
denly he leaned close to her, be- 
gan to talk fast, feverishly. “Juby, 
that city — that world — was built 
by people. Why did they build 
and why do we not? What is the 
difference between those people 
and ours?” 

“They must have had . .” 

“They had nothing we don’t 
have. They’re the same kind of 
people; they used something we 
haven’t been using. Juby, I’ve got 
that something. I can build. I can 
make others build.” 

A mental picture of the tower 
glimmered before her. “You built 
it with hate,” she said wondering- 
ly. “Is that what they had — 
cruelty, brutality, hatred?” 

“Yes!” 

“I don’t believe it! I don’t be- 
lieve anyone could live with that 
much hate!” 

“Perhaps not. Perhaps they 
didn’t. But they built with it. 
They built because, some men 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



21 




could flog others into building for 
them, building higher and faster 
than all the good neighbors 
would ever do helping one an- 
other.” 

“They’d hate the man who 
made them build like that.” 

Osser’s hands crackled as he 
pressed them together. He laugh- 
ed, and the echoes took every- 
thing that was unpleasant about 
that laughter and filled the far 
reaches of the dark room with it. 

“They’d hate him,” he agreed. 
“But he’s strong, you see. He 
» was strong in the first place, to 
make them build, and he’s strong- 
er afterward with what they built 
for him. Do you know the only 
way they can express their hatred, 
once they find he’s too strong for 
them?” 

Jubilith shook her head. 

“They’d build,” he chuckled. 
“They’d build higher and faster 
than he did. They would find the 
strongest man among them and 
ask him to flog them into it. 
That’s the way a great city goes 
up. A strong man builds, and 
strong men follow, and soon the 
man who’s strongest of all makes 
all the other strong ones do his 
work. Do you see?” 

“And the . the others, the 
weak?” 

“What of them?” he asked 
scornfully. “There are more of 
them than strong ones — so there 
are more hands to do the strong 



man’s work. And why shouldn’t 
they? Don’t they get the city to 
live in when it’s built? Don't they 
ride about in swift shining car- 
riers and fly through the air in 
the bird machines?” 

“Would they be— -happy?” she 
asked. 

H E looked at her in genuine 
puzzlement. “Happy?” He 
smashed a heavy fist into his 
palm. “They’d have a city!” 
Again the words tumbled from 
him. “How do you live, you and 
the rest of the village? What do 
you do when you want a — well, 
a garden, food from the ground?” 
“I dig up the soil,” she said. 
“I plant and water and weed.” 
“Suppose you want a plow?” 
“I make one. Or I do work for 
someone who has one.” 

“Uh,” he grunted. “And there 
you are, hundreds of you in the 
village, each one planting a little, 
smithing a little, thatching and 
cutting and building a little. Ev- 
eryone does everything except for 
how many — four, five? — the 
leather-worker, old Griak who 
makes wooden pegs for house- 
beams, one or two others.” 

“They like to do just one work. 
But anyone can do any of the 
work. Those few, we take care 
of. Someone has to keep the 
skills alive.” 

He snorted. “Put a strong man 
in the village and give him strong

“Protect them? Against what?” 
“Against the other strong ones. 
There would be others.” 

“And you—” 

“I shall be the strongest of 
all,” he said proudly. He waved 
at the box. “We were a great peo- 
ple once. We’re ants now — less 
than ants, for at least the ants 
work together for a common pur- 
pose. I’ll make us great again.’-’ 
His head sank onto his hand and 
he looked somberly into the 
shadows. “Something happened 
to this world. Something smashed 
the cities and the people and 
drove them down to what they 
are today. Something was broken 
within them, and they no longer 



dared to be great. Well, they will 
be. I have the extra something 
that was smashed out of them.” 

“What smashed them, Qsser?” 

“Who can know? I don’t. I 
don’t care, either.” He tapped her 
with a long forefinger to empha- 
size. “All I care about is this: 
They were smashed because 
they were not strong enough. I 
shall be so strong I can’t be 
smashed.” 

She said, “A stomach can hold 
only so much. A man asleep 
takes just so much space. So 
much and no more clothing 
makes one comfortable. Why do 
you want more than these things, 
Osser?” 

She knew he was annoyed, and 
knew, too, that he was consider- 
ing the question as honestly as 
he could. 

“It’s because I ... I want to 
be strong,” he said in a strained 
voice. 

“You are strong.” 

“Who knows that?” he raged, 
and the echoes giggled and whis- 
pered. 

“I do. Wrenn. Sussten. The 
whole village.” 

“The whole world will know. 
They will all do things for me.” 

She thought, But everyone does 
everything for himself, all over 
the wojld. Except, she added, 
those who aren’t able . 

With that in mind, she looked 
at him, his oaken shoulders, his

powerful, bitter mouth. She 
touched the bruises his hands had 
left, and the beginhings of the 
understanding she had been grop- 
ing for left her completely. 

She said dully, “Your tower 
. you’d better get back there.” 
“Work goes on,” he said, smil- 
ing tightly, “whether I’m there 
or not, as long as they don’t know 
my plans. They are afraid. But — 
yes, we can go now.” 

R ISING, he flicked the stud of 
his torch. It flared blue- 
white, faded to the weak orange 
of Jubilith’s, then died. 

“The light . .” 

“It’s all right,” said Jubilith. 
“I have mine.” 

“When they get like that, so 
dim, you can’t tell when they’ll 
go out. Come — hurry! This place' 
is full of corridors; without light, 
we could be lost here for days.’” 
She glanced around at the 
crowding shadows. “Make it 
work again,” she suggested. 

He looked at the dead torch 
in his hand. “You,” he said 
flatly. He tossed it. She caught it 
in her free hand, put her torch 
on the floor, and held the broken 
one down so she could see it in 
the waning orange glow. She 
turned it over twice, her sensi- 
tive hands feeling with every part 
rather than with fingertips alone. 
She held it still and closed her 
eyes; and then it came to her, 



and she grasped one end with her 
right hand and the other with her 
left, and twisted. 

There was a faint click and the 
outer shell of the torch separated. 
She drew off the butt end of it; 
it was just a hollow shell. The 
entire mechanism was attached 
to the lens end and was now ex- 
posed. 

She turned it over carefully, 
keeping her fingers away from 
the workings. Again she closed 
her eyes and thought, and at last 
she bent close and peered. She 
nodded, fumbled in her hair, and 
detached a copper clasp. She 
bent and broke off a narrow strip 
of it and inserted it carefully 
into the light mechanism. Very 
carefully, she pried apart two 
small strands of wire, dipped a 
little deeper, hooked onto a tiny 
white sphere, and drew it out. 

“Poor thing,” she murmured 
under her breath. 

“Poor what?” 

“Spider’s egg,” she said rue- 
fully. “They fight so to save 
them; and this one will never 
hatch out now. It’s been burned.” 

She picked up the butt-end 
housing, slipped the two parts 
together, and twisted them until 
they clicked. She handed the 
torch to Osser. 

“You’ve wasted time,” he com- 
plained, surly. 

“No, I haven’t,” she said. 
“We’ll have light now.”

He touched the stud on the 
torch. The brilliant, comforting, 
white light poured from it. 

“Yes,” he admitted quietly. 

Watching his face as he han- 
dled the torch, she knew that if 
the could read what was in his 
mind in that second, she would 
have the answer to everything 
about him. She could not, how- 
ever, and he said nothing, but 
led across the room to the dark 
corridor. 

He was silent all the way back 
to the broken steps. 

They stood halfway up, letting 
their eyes adjust to the daylight 
which poured down on them, and 
he said, “You didn’t even try the 
torch to see if it would work, 
after you took out that egg.” 

“I knew it Would work.” She 
looked at him, amazed. “You’re 
angry.” 

“Yes,” he said. 

He took her torch and his and 
put them away in a niche in the 
ruined stair -well, and they climb- 
ed up into the noon light. It was 
all but intolerable, as the two 
suns were all but in syzygy, the 
blue-white midget shining 
through the great pale gaseous 
mass of the giant, so that togeth- 
er they cast only a single shadow. 

“It will be hot this afternoon,” 
she said, but he was silent, steep- 
ed in some bitterness of his own, 
so she followed him quietly with- 
out attempting conversation. 



O LD Oyva stirred sleepily in 
her basking chair, and sud- 
denly sat upright. 

Jubilith approached her, pale 
and straight. “Is it Oyva?” 

“It is, Jubilith,” said the old 
woman. “I knew you would be 
back, my dear. I’m sore in my 
heart with you.” 

“Is he here?” 

“He is. He has been on a journ- 
ey. You’ll find him tired.” 

“He should have been here, 
with all that has happened,” 
said Jubilith. 

“He should have done exactly 
as he has done,” Oyva stated 
bluntly. 

Jubilith recognized the enor- 
mity of her rudeness, and the 
taste of it was bad in her mouth. 
One did not criticize Wrenn’s 
comings and goings. 

She faced Oyva and closed her 
eyes humbly.' 

Oyva touched her. “It’s all 
right, child. You are distressed. 
Wrenn!” she called. “She is 
here!” 

“Come, Jubilith,” Wrenn’s 
voice called from the house. 

“He knows? No one knew I 
was coming here!” 

“He knows,” said Oyva. “Go to 
him, child.” 

Jubilith entered the house. 
Wrenn sat in his corner. The 
musical instrument was nowhere 
in sight. Aside from his cushions, 
there was nothing in the room. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



25 



Wrenn gave her his wise, sweet 
smile. “Jubilith,” he said. “Come 
close.” He looked drawn and 
pale, but quite untroubled. He 
put a cushion by him and she 
crossed slowly and sank down 
on it. 

He was quiet, and when she 
was sure it was because he wait- 
ed for her to speak, she said, 
“Some things may not be under- 
stood.” 

“True,” he agreed. 

She kneaded her hands. “Is 
there never a change?” 

“Always,” he said, “when it’s 
time.” ’ 

“Osser— ” 

“Everyone will understand Os- 
ser very soon now.” 

She screwed up her courage. 
“Soon is not soon enough. I must 
know him now.” 

“Before anyone else?” he in- 
quired mildly. 

“Let everyone know now,” she 
suggested. 

He shook his head and there 
was no appeal in it. 

“Then let me. I shall be a part 
of you and speak of it only to 
you.’* 

“Why must you understand?” 

S HE shuddered. It was not cold, 
or fear, but simply the surg- 
ings of a great emotion. 

“I love him,” she said. “And to 
love is to guard and protect. He 
needs me.” 



“Go to him then.” But she sat 
where she was, her long eyes cast 
down, weeping. Wrenn said, 
“There is more, then?” 

“I love . .” She threw out an 
arm in a gesture which enfolded 
Wrenn, the house, the village. “I 
love the people, too, the gardens, 
the little houses; the way we go 
and come, and sing, and make 
music, and make our own tools 
and clothes. To love is to guard 
and protect . and I love these 
things, and I love Osser. I can 
destroy Osser, because he would 
not expect it of me; and, if I did, 
I would protect all of you. But 
if I protect him, he will destroy 
you. There is no answer to such 
a problem, Wrenn; it is a road,” 
she cried, “with a precipice at 
each end, and no standing still!” 

“And understanding him would 
be an answer?” 

“There’s no other!” She turned 
her face up to him, imploring. 
“Osser is strong, Wrenn, with a 
— a new thing about him, a thing 
none of the rest of us have. He 
has told me of it. It is a thing 
that can change us, make us part 
of him. He will build cities with 
our hands, on our broken bodies 
if we resist him. He wants us to 
be a great people again — he says 
we were, once, and have lost it 
all.” 

“And do you regard that as 
greatness, Jubilith — the towers, 
the bird-machines?” 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“How did you know of them? 
. Greatness? I don’t know, I 
don’t know,” she said, and wept. 
“I love him, and he wants to 
build a city with a wanting great- 
er than anything I have ever 
known or heard of before. Could 
he do it, Wrenn? Could he?” 

“He might,” said Wrenn calm- 
ly- 

“He is in the village now. He 
has about him the ones who built 
his tower for him. They cringe 
around him, hating to be near 
and afraid to leave. He sent them 
one by one to tell all the people 
to come out to the foothills to- 
morrow, to begin work on his 
city. He wants enough building 
done in one hundred days to 
shelter everyone, because then, 
he says, he is going to burn this 
village to the ground. Why, 
Wrenn — why?” 

“Perhaps,” said Wrenn, “so 
that we may all face his strength 
and yield to it. A man who could 
move a whole village in a hun- 
dred days just to show his 
strength would be a strong man 
indeed.” 

“What shall we do?” 

“I think we shall go out to the 
foothills in the morning and be- 
gin to build.” 

She rose and went to the door. 

“I know what to do now,” she 
whispered. “I won’t try to under- 
stand any more. I shall just go 
and help him.” 



“Yes, go,” said Wrenn, “He will 
need you.” 

J UBILITH stood with Osser on 
the parapet, and with him 
stared into the dappled dawn. 
The whole sky flamed with the 
loom of the red sun’s light, but 
the white one preceded it up the 
sky, laying sharp shadows in the 
soft blunt ones. Birds called 
and chattered in the Sky-tree 
Grove, and deep in the thickets 
the seven-foot bats grunted .as 
they settled in to sleep. 

“Suppose they don’t come?” 
she asked. 

“They’ll come,” he said grimly. 
“Jubilith, why are you here?” 
She said, “I don’t know what 
you are doing, Osser. I don’t 
know whether it’s right or wheth- 
er you will keep on succeeding. I 
do know there will be pain and 
difficulty and I — I came to keep 
you safe, if I could ... I love 
you.” 

He looked down at her, as 
thick and dark over her as his 
tower was over the foothills. One 
side of his mouth twitched. 

“Little butterfly,” he said soft- 
ly, “do you think you can guard 
me ?” 

Everything beautiful about her 
poured out to him through her 
beautiful face, and for a moment 
his world had three suns instead 
of two. He put his arms around 
her. Then his great voice explod- 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



27 




ed with two syllables of a mighty 
laugh. He lifted her and swung 
her behind him, and leaped to 
the parapet. 

Deeply shaken, she came to 
follow his gaze. 

The red sun’s foggy limb was 
above the townward horizon, and 
silhouetted against it came the 
van of a procession. On they 
came and on, the j^oung men of 
the village, the fathers. Women 
were with them, too, and every- 
thing on wheels that the village 
possessed — flat-bed wagons, two- 
wheeled rickshaw carts, children’s 
and vendors’ and pleasure ve- 
hicles. A snorting team of four 
tiger-oxen clawed along before a 
heavily laden stone-boat, and 
men shared packs that swung in 
the center of long poles. 

Osser curled his lip. “You see 
them,” he said, as if to himself, 
“doing the only thing they can 
think of. Push them, they yield. 
The clods!” he spat. “Well, one 
day, one will push back. And 
when he does, -I’ll break him, and 
after that I’ll use him. Meantime 
— I have a thousand hands and a 
single mind. We’ll see building 
now,” he crooned. “When they’ve 
built, they’ll know what they 
don’t know now — that they’re 
men.” 

“They’ve all come,” breathed 
Jubilith. “All of them. Osser — ” 

“Be quiet,” he said, leaning 
into the wind to watch, gloating. 



With the feel of his hard hands 
still on her back, she discovered 
with a crushing impact that there 
was no room in his heart for her 
when he thought of his building. 
And she knew that there never 
would be, except perhaps for a 
stolen moment, a touch in pass- 
ing. With the pain of that reali- 
zation came the certainty that 
she would stay with him always, 
even for so little. 

The procession dipped out of 
sight, then slowly rose over and 
down the near hill and approach- 
ed the tower. It spread and thick- 
ened at the foot of the slope, as 
men cast about, testing the 
ground with their picks, eying 
the land for its color and vegeta- 
tion and drainage ... or was that 
what they were doing? 

|"kSSER leaned his elbows on 
the parapet and shook his 
head pityingly at their inefficien- 
cy. Look at the way they went 
about laying out houses! And 
their own houses. Well, he’d let 
them mill about until they were 
completely confused, and then 
he’d go down and make them do 
it his way. Confused men are 
soft men; men working against 
their inner selves are easy to di- 
vert from outside. 

Beside him, Jubilith gasped. 

“What is it?” 

She pointed. “There — sending 
the men to this side, that side. 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




See, by the stone -boat? It’s 
Wrenn!” 

“Nonsense!” said Osser, “He’d 
never leave his house. Not to walk 
around among people who are 
sweating. He deals only with peo- 
ple who tell him he’s right before 
he speaks.” 

“It’s Wrenn, it is, it is!” cried 
Jubilith. She clutched his arm. 
“Osser, I’m afraid!” 

“Afraid? Afraid of what? . 
By the dying Red One, it is 
Wrenn, telling men what to do as 
if this was his city.” He laughed. 
“There are few enough here who 
are strong, Juby, but he’s the 
strongest there is. And look at 
him scurry around for me!” 

“I’m afraid,” Jubilith whimp- 
ered. ✓ 

“They jump , when he tells 
them,” said Osser reflectively, 
shading his eyes. “Perhaps I was 
wrong to let them tire themselves 
out before I help them do things 
right. With a man like him to 
push them- . Hm. I think we’ll 
get it done right the first time.” 
He pushed himself away from 
the parapet and swung to the 
stairway. 

“Osser, don’t, please don’t!” 
she begged. 

He stopped just long enough 
to give her a glance like a stone 
thrown. “You’ll never change my 
mind, Juby, and you’ll be hurt 
if you try too often.” He dropped 
into the opening, went down 



three steps, five steps . 

He grunted, stopped. 

Jubilith came slowly over to 
the stairwell. Osser stood on the 
sixth step, on tiptoe. Impossibly 
on tiptoe : the points of his sand- 
als barely touched the step at 
all. 

He set his jaw and placed his 
massive hands one on each side 
of the curved wall. He pressed 
them out and up, forcing himself 
downward. His sandals touched 
more firmly; his toes bent, his 
heels made contact. His face be- 
came deep red, and the cords at 
the sides of his neck ridged like 
a weathered fallow-field. 

A strained crackle came from 
his shoulders, and then the pent 
breath burst from him. His hands 
slipped, and he came up again 
just the height of the single stair- 
riser, to bob ludicrously like a 
boat at anchor, his pointed toe 
touching and lifting from the 
sixth step. 

He gave an inarticulate roar, 
bent double, and plunged his 
hands downward as if to dive 
head-first down the stairs. His 
wrists turned under and he yelp- 
ed with the pain. More cautious- 
ly he felt around and down, from 
wall to wall. It was as if the air 
in the stairway had solidified, 
become at once viscous and re- 
silient. Whatever was there was 
invisible and completely impas- 
sable. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



29 



TTE backed slowly up the steps. 

On his face there was fury 
and frustration, hurt and a shak- 
ing reaction. 

Jubilith wrung her hands. 
“Please, please, Osser, be care — ” 

The sound of her voice gave 
him something to strike out at, 
and he spun about, raising his 
great bludgeon of a fist. Jubilith 
stood frozen; too shocked to 
dodge the blow. 

"Osser/” 

Osser stopped, tensed high, fist 
up, like some terrifying monu- 
ment to vengeance. The voice 
had been Wrenn’s — Wrenn speak- 
ing quietly, even conversationally, 
but magnified beyond belief. The 
echoes of it rolled off and were 
lost in the hills. 

“Come watch men building, 
Osser/” 

Dazed, Osser lowered his t arm 
and went to the parapet. 

Far below, near the base of the 
hill, Wrenn' stood, looking up at 
the tower. When Osser appeared, 
Wrenn turned his back and sig- 
naled the men by the stone -boat. 
They twitched away the tarpaul- 
in that covered its load. 

Osser’ s hands gripped the stone 
as if they would powder it. His 
eyes slowly widened and his jaw 
slowly dropped. 

At first it seemed like a mound 
of silver on the rude platform of 
the ox-drawn stone-boat. Gradu- 
ally he perceived that it was a 



machine, a machine so finished, 
so clean-lined and so business- 
like that the pictures he had 
shown Jubilith were clumsy toys 
in comparison. 

It was Sussten, a man Osser 
had crushed to the ground with 
two heavy blows, who sprang 
lightly up on the machine and 
settled into it. It backed off the 
platform, and Osser could hear 
the faintest of whines from it. 
The machine rolled and yet it 
stepped; it kept itself horizon- 
level as it ran, its long endless 
treads dipping and rising with 
the terrain, its sleek body moving 
smooth as a swan. It stopped and 
then went forward, out to the first 
of a field of stakes that a crew 
had been driving. 

The flat, gleaming sides of the 
machine opened away and for- 
ward and locked, and became a 
single blade twice the width of 
the machine. It dropped until 
its sharp lower edge just touched 
the ground, checked for a mo- 
ment, and then sank into the 
soil. 

Dirt mounded up before it 
until flakes fell back over the 
wide moldboard. The machine 
slid ahead, and dirt ran off the 
sides of the blade to make two 
straight windrows. And behind 
the machine as it labored, the 
ground was flat and smooth; and 
it was done as easily as a smooth- 
ing hand in a sandbox. Here it 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




was cut and there it was filled, 
but everywhere the swath was 
like planed wood, all done just 
as fast as a man can run. 

Osser made a sick noise far 
back in his tight throat. 

UIDED by the stakes, the 
machine wheeled and return- 
ed, one end of the blade now 
curved forward to catch up the 
windrow 'and carry it across the 
new parallel cut. And now the 
planed soil was twice as wide. 

As it worked, men worked, and 
Osser saw that, shockingly, they 
moved with no less efficiency and 
certainty than the machine. For 
Osser, these men had plodded and 
sweated, drudged, each a single, 
obstinate unit to be flogged and 
pressed. But now they sprinted, 
sprang; they held, drove, meas- 
ured and carried as if to swift 
and intricate music. 

A cart clattered up and from it 
men took metal spikes, as thick 
as a leg, twice as tall as a man. 
Four men to a spike, they ran 
with them to staked positions on 
the new-cut ground, set them 
upright. A man flung a metal 
clamp around the spike. Two 
men, one on each side, drove 
down on the clamp with heavy 
sledges until the spike would 
stand alone. And already those 
four were back with another 
spike. 

Twenty-six such spikes were 



set, but long before they were all 
out of the wagon, Sussten spun 
the machine in its own length 
and stopped. The moldboard 
rose, hinged, folded back to be- 
come the silver sides of the ma- 
chine again. Sussten drove 
forward, nosed the machine into 
the first of the spikes, which fit- 
ted into a slot at the front of the 
machine. There was the sound of 
a frantic giant ringing a metal 
triangle, and the spike sank as if 
the ground had turned to bread. 

Leaving perhaps two hand’s- 
breadths of the spike showing, 
the machine slid to the next and 
the next, sinking the spikes so 
quickly that it had almost & 
whole minute to wait while the 
spike crew set the very last one. 
At that a sound rolled out of the 
crowd, a sound utterly unlike 
any that had ever been heard 
during the building of the tower 
— a friendly, jeering roar of 
laughter at the crew who had 
made the machine wait. 

Men unrolled heavy cable 
along the lines of spikes; others 
followed right behind them, one 
with a tool which stretched the 
cable taut, two with a tool that 
in two swift motions connected 
the cable to the tops of the sunk- 
en spikes. And by the time the 
cable was connected, two flat- 
beds, a buckboard and a hay 
wagon had unloaded a cluster of 
glistening machine parts. Men 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



31 




and women swarmed over them, 
wrenches, pliers and special tools 
in hand, bolting, fitting, clamp- 
ing, connecting. Three heavy 
leads from the great ground cable 
were connected; a great parabolic 
wire basket was raised and guyed. 

Wrenn ran to the structure 
and pulled a lever. A high-pitch- 
ed scream of force dropped sick- 
eningly in pitch to a jarring 
subsonic, and rose immediately 
high out of the audible range. 

A rosy haze enveloped the end 
of the new machine, opposite the 
ground array and under the bask- 
et. It thickened, shimmered, and 
steadied, until it was a stable 



glowing sphere with an off-focus 
muzziness barely showing all 
around its profile. 

rrtHE crowd — not a group now, 
but a line — cheered and the 
line moved forward. Every con- 
ceivable village conveyance 
moved in single file toward the 
shining sphere, and, as each 
stopped, heavy metal was un- 
loaded. Cast-iron stove legs 
could be recognized, and long 
strips of tinning solder, a bell, a 
kettle, the framing of a bench. 
The blacksmith’s anvil was there, 
and parts of his forge. Pots and 
skillets. A ratchet and pawl from 




32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the gristmill. The weights and 
pendulum from the big village 
clock. 

As each scrap was unloaded, 
exactly the number of hands de- 
manded by its weight were wait- 
ing to catch it, swing it from its 
conveyance into the strange 
sphere. They went in without 
resistance and without sound, 
and they did not come out. Wag- 
on after wagon, pack after hand- 
sack were unloaded, and still the 
sphere took and took. 

It took heavy metal of more 
mass than its own dimensions. 
Had the metal been melted down 
into a sphere, it would have been 



a third again, half again, twice 
as large as the sphere, and still 
it took. 

But its color was changing. The 
orange went to burned sienna and 
then to a strident brown. Im- 
perceptibly this darkened until 
at last it was black. For a mo- 
ment, it was a black of impossible 
glossiness, but this softened. 
Blacker and blacker it became, 
and at length it was not a good 
thing to look into— the blackness 
seemed to be hungry for some- 
thing more intimate than metal. 
And still the metals came and 
the sphere took. 

A great roar came from the 





crowd; men fell back to look up- 
ward. High in the west was a 
glowing golden spark which 
showed a long blue tail. It raced 
across the sky and was gone, and 
moments later the human roar 
was answered by thunder from 
above. 

If the work had been swift be- 
fore, it now became a blur. Men 
no longer waited for the line of 
wagons to move, but ran back 
along it to snatch metal and stag- 
ger forward again to the sphere. 
Women ripped off bracelets and 
hammered earrings and threw 
them to the implacable melano- 
sphere. Men threw ip their knives, 
even their buttons. A rain of 
metal was sucked silently into 
the dazzling black. 

Another cry from the crowd, 
and now there was hurried an- 
guish in it; again the craning 
necks, the quick gasp. The golden 
spark was a speed-blurred ovoid 
now, the blue tail a banner half 
a horizon long. The roar, when 
it came, was a smashing thunder, 
and the blue band hung where it 
was long after the thing had gone. 

A moan of urgency, caught and 
maintained by one exhausted 
throat after another, rose and fell 
and would not leave. Then it was 
a happy shout as Sussten drove 
in, shouldering the beautiful cut- 
ting machine through the scatter- 
ing crowd. Its blade unfolded as 
it ran, latched high and stayed 



there like a shining forearm flung 
across the machine’s silver face. 

As the last scrambling people 
dove for safety, Sussten brought 
the huge blade slashing down- 
ward and at the same time threw 
the machine into its highest 
speed. It leaped forward as Suss- 
ten leaped back. Unmanned, it 
rushed at the sphere as if to 
sweep it away, crash the struc- 
ture that contained it. But at the 
last micro-second, the blade 
struck the ground; the nose of 
the machine snapped upward, 
and the whole gleaming thing 
literally vaulted into the sphere. 

TVTO words exist for such a 
' black. Some people fell to 
their knees, their faces covered. 
Some turned blindly away, un- 
steady on their feet. Some stood 
trembling, fixed on it, until 
friendly hands took and turned 
them and coaxed them back to 
reality. # 

And at last a man staggered 
close, squinting, and threw in the 
heavy wrought-iron support for 
an inn sign — 

And the sphere refused it. 

Such a cry of joy rose from 
the village that the sleeping bats 
in the thickets of Sky-tree Grove, 
two miles away, stirred and add- 
ed their porcine grunting to the 
noise. 

A woman ran to Wrenn, 
screaming, elbowing, unnoticed 



34 



galaxy science fiction 




and unheard in the bedlam. She 
caught his shoulder roughly, spun 
him half around, pointed. Point- 
ed up at the tower, at Osser. 

Wrenn thumbed a small disc 
out of a socket in his belt and 
held it near his lips. 

“Osser!” The great voice rang 
and echoed, crushing the ecstatic 
noises of the people by its sheer 
weight. “Osser, come down or 
you’re a dead man!” 

The people, suddenly silent, all 
stared at the tower. One or two 
cried, “Yes, come down, come 
down . .” but the puniness of 
their voices was ludicrous after 
Wrenn’s magnified tones, and 
few tried again. 

Osser stood holding the para- 
pet, legs wide apart, eyes widfc— 
too wide — open. His hands curl- 
ed over the edge, and blood drip- 
ped slowly from under the 
cuticles. 

“Come down, come down . , .” 
He did not move. His eyeballs 
were nearly dry, and unnoticed 
saliva lay in a drying streak from 
one corner of his mouth. 
“Jubilith, bring him down!” 
She was whimpering, begging, 
murmuring little urgencies to 
him. His biceps were as hard as 
the parapet, his face as change- 
less as the stone. 

“Jubilith, leave him! Leave 
him and come!” Wrenn, wise 
Wrenn, sure, unshakable, imper- 
turbable Wrenn had a sob in his 



voice; and under such amplifica- 
tion the sob was almost big 
enough to be voice for the sobs 
that twisted through Jubilith’s 
tight throat. 

She dropped to one knee and 
put one slim firm shoulder under 
Osser’s wrist. She drove upward 
against it with all the lithe 
strength of her panicked body. It 
came free, leaving a clot of fing- 
ertip on the stone. Down she went 
again, and up again at the other 
wrist; but this was suddenly 
flaccid, and her tremendous ef- 
fort turned to a leap. She clutched 
at Osser, who tottered forward. 

For one endless second they 
hung there, while their mutual 
center of gravity made a slow de- 
liberation, and then Jubilith 
kicked frantically at the parapet, 
abrading her legs, mingling her 
blood with his on the masonry. 
They went together back to the 
roof. Jubilith twisted like a fall- 
ing cat and got her feet down, 
holding Osser’s great weight up. 

They spun across the roof in 
an insane staggering dance; then 
there was the stairway (with its 
invisible barrier gone) and dark- 
ness (with his hand in hers now, 
holding and leading) and a 
sprint into daylight and the shat- 
tering roar of Wrenn’s giant 
voice: “Everybody down, down 
ilatr 

And there was a time of run- 
ning, pulling Osser after her, and 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



35 




Osser pounding along behind her, 
docile and wide-eyed as a cat-ox. 
And then the rebellion and fail- 
ure of her legs, and the will that 
refused to let them fail, and the 
failure of that will; the stunning 
agony of a cracked patella as she 
went down on the rocks, and the 
swift sense of infinite loss as Os- 
ser’s hand pulled free of hers and 
he went lumbering blindly along, 
the only man on his feet in the 
wide meadow of the fallen. 

Jubilith screamed and someone 
stood up — she thought it was old 
Oyva — and cried out. 

Then the mighty voice again, 
“Osser/ Down , man!" Blearily, 
then, she saw Osser stagger to a 
halt and peer around him. 

“Osser, lie down!” 

A ND then Osser, mad, drooling, 
turning toward her. His eyes 
protruded and he slashed about 
with his heavy fists. He came 
closer, unseeing, battling some 
horror he believed in with great 
cuts and slashes that threatened 
elbow and shoulder joints by the 
wrenching of their unimpeded 
force. 

His voice — but not his, rather 
the voice of an old, wretched 
crone — squeaking out in a shrill 
falsetto, “Not down, never down, 
but up. I’ll build, build, build, 
break to build, kill to build, and 
all the ones who can do every- 
thing, anything, everything, they 



will build everything for me. I’m 
strong!” he shrieked, soprano. 
“All the people who can do any- 
thing are less than one strong 
man . .” 

He jabbered and fought, and 
suddenly Wrenn rose, quite close 
by, his left hand enclosed in a 
round flat box. He moved some- 
thing on its surface and then 
waved it at Osser, in a gesture 
precisely like the command to 
a guest to be seated. 

Down went Osser, close to 
Jubilith, with his face in the dirt 
and his eyes open, uncaring. On 
him and on Jubilith lay the in- 
visible weight of the force that 
had awaited him in the stair- 
way. 

The breath hissed out of Jubi- 
lith. Had she not been lying on 
her side with her face turned sky- 
ward in a single convulsive effort 
toward air, she would never have 
seen what happened. The golden 
shape appeared in the west, seen 
a fraction of a second, but blaz- 
oned forever in tangled memories 
of this day. And simultaneously 
the earth-shaking cough of the 
machine as its sphere disappear- 
ed. 

She could not see it move, but 
such a blackness is indelible, and 
she sensed it when it appeared in 
the high distances as its trajec- 
tory and that of the golden flyer 
intersected. 

Then there was — Nothing. 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




fTiHE broad blue trail swept 
from the western horizon to 
the zenith, and sharply ended. 
There was no sound, no. concus- 
sion, no blaze of light. The sphere 
met the ship and both ceased to 
exist. 

Then there was the wind, from 
nowhere, from everywhere, all 
the wind that ever was, tearing in 
agony from everywhere in the 
world to the place where the 
sphere had been, trying to fill the 
strange space that had contained 
exactly as much matter as the 
dead golden ship. Wagons, oxen, 
trees and stones scraped and flew 
and crashed together in the center 
of that monstrous implosion. 

The weight Wrenn had laid on 
Jubilith disappeared, but her 
sucking lungs could find nothing 
to draw in. There was air aplenty, 
but none of it would serve her. 

Finally she realized that there 
was unconsciousness waiting for 
her if she wanted it. She em- 
braced it, sank into it, and left 
the world to its wailing winds. 

Ages later, there was weeping. 

She stirred and raised her 
head. 

The sphere machine was gone. 
There was a heap of something 
down there, but it supported such 
a tall and heavy pillar of roiling 
dust that she could not see what 
it was. There, and there, and over 
yonder, in twos and threes, si- 
lent, shaken people sat up, some 



staring about them, some just 
sitting, waiting for the shock- 
stopped currents of life to flow 
back in. 

But the weeping . 

She put her palm on the ground 
and inched it, heel first, in a 
weak series of little hops, until 
she was half sitting. 

Osser was weeping. 

He sat upright, his feet to- 
gether and his knees wide apart, 
like a little child. He rocked. He 
lifted his hands and let them fall, 
lifted them and punctuated his 
crying with weak poundings on 
the ground. His mouth was an O, 
his eyes were single squeezed 
' lines, his face was wet, and his 
crying was the most heartrending 
sound she had ever heard. 

She thought to speak to him, 
but knew he would not hear. She 
thought to go to him, but the 
first shift of weight sent such 
agony through her broken knee- 
cap that she almost fainted. 

Osser wept. 

She turned away from him — 
suppose, later, he should remem- 
ber that she had seen this? — and 
then she knew why he. was cry- 
ing. He was crying because his 
tower was gone. Tower of 
strength, tower of defiance, tower 
of hope, tower of rebellion and 
hatred and an ambition big 
enough for a whole race of city- 
builders, gone without a fight, 
gone without the triumph of tak-

ing him with it, gone in an in- 
stant, literally in a puff of wind. 

“Where does it hurt?” 

It was Wrenn, who had ap- 
proached unseen through the 
blinding, sick compassion that 
filled her. 

“It hurts there.” She pointed 
briefly at Osser. 

“I know,” said Wrenn gently. 
He checked what she was about 
to say with a gesture. “No, we 
won’t stop him. When he was a 
little boy, he never cried. He has 
been hurt more than most people, 
and nothing ever made him cry, 
ever. We all have a cup for tears 
and a reservoir. No childhood is 
finished until all the tears flow 
from the reservoir into the cup. 
Let him cry; perhaps he is going 
to be a man. It’s your knee, isn’t 
it?” 

“Yes. Oh, but I can’t stand to 
hear it, my heart will burst!” she 
cried. 

“Hear him out,” said Wrenn 
softly, taking medication from a 
flat box at his waist. He ran 
feather-fingers over her knee and 
nodded. “You have taken Osser 
as your own. Keep this weeping 
with you, all of it. It will fit you 
to him better through the heal- 
ing time.” 

“May I understand now?” 

“Yes, oh yes . and since he 
has taught you about hate, you 
will hate me for it.” 

“I couldn’t hate you, Wrenn.” 



Something stirred within his 
placid eyes — a smile, a pointed 
shard of knowledge — she was not 
sure. “Perhaps you could.” 

TTE kept his eyes on his care- 
ful bandaging, and as he 
worked, he spoke. 

“Stop a man in his work to tell 
him that each of his fingers bears 
a pattern of loops and whorls, 
and you waste his time. It is a 
thing he knows, a thing he has 
seen for himself, a thing which 
can be checked on the instant — 
in short, an obvious, unremark- 
able thing. Yet, if his attention is 
not called to it, it is impossible to 
teach him that these patterns are 
exclusive, original with him, un- 
duplicated anywhere. Sparing 
him the truism may cost him the 
fact. 

“It is that kind of truism 
through which I shall pass to 
reach the things you must under- 
stand. So be patient with me 
through the familiar paths; I 
promise you a most remarkable 
turning. 

“We are an ancient and re- 
sourceful species, and among the 
many things we have — our hap- 
piness, our simplicity, our har- 
mony with each other and with 
ourselves — some are the products 
of intelligence, per se, but most 
of the good things spring from a 
quality which we possess in great- 
er degree than any other species

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



yet known. That is — logic: 

“Now, there is the obvious 
logic: you may never have bro- 
ken your knee before, but you 
knew, in advance, that if you 
did it would cause you pain. If 
I hold this pebble so, you may 
correctly predict that it will drop 
when I release it, though you 
have never seen this stone before. 
This obvious logic strikes deeper 
levels as well; for example, if I 
release the stone and it does not 
fall, logic tells you not only that 
some unpredicted force is now 
acting on it, but a great many 
things about that force: that it 
equals gravity in the case of this 
particular pebble; that it is in 
stasis; that it is phenomenal, 
since it is out of the statistical 
order of things. 

“The quality of logic, which 
we (so far as is known) uniquely 
possess, is this: any of us can do 
literally anything that anyone 
else can do. You need ask no one 
to solve the problems that you 
face every day, providing they 
are problems common to all. To 
cut material so that a sleeve will 
fit a shoulder, you pause, you 
» close your eyes; the way to cut 
the material then comes to you, 
and you proceed. You never need 
do anything twice, because the 
first way is the most logical. You 
may finish the garment and put 
it away without trying it on for 
fit, because you know you have 



done it right and it is perfect. 

“If I put you before a machine 
which you had never seen before, 
which had a function unknown to 
you, and which operated on prin- 
ciples you had never heard of, 
and if I told you it was broken 
and needed repairing, you would 
look at it carefully, inside, out- 
side, top and bottom, and you 
would close your eyes, and sud- 
denly you would understand the 
principles. With these and the 
machine, function would explain 
itself. The step from that point 
to the location of a faulty part 
is self-evident. 

“Now I lay before you parts 
vfrhich are identical in appearance, 
and ask you to install the correct 
one. Since you thoroughly under- 
stand the requirements now, the 
specifications for the correct part 
are self-evident. Logic dictates 
the correct tests for the parts. 
You will rapidly reject the tight 
one, the heavy one, the too soft 
one, and the too resilient one, 
and you will repair my machine. 
And you will walk away without 
testing it, since you now know it 
will operate.” 

RENN continued, “You — 
all of us — live in this way. 
We build no cities because we 
don’t need cities. We stay in 
groups because some things need 
more than two hands, more than 
one head, or voice, or mood. We

39 




eat exactly what we require, we 
use only what we need. 

“And that is the end of the 
truism, wherein I so meticulously 
describe to you what you know 
about how you live. The turn- 
ing: Whence this familiar phe- 
nomenon, this closing of the eyes 
and mysterious appearance of the 
answer? There have been many 
engrossing theories about it, but 
the truth is the most fascinating 
of all. 

' “We have all spoken of telep- 
athy, and many of us have ex- 
perienced it. We cannot explain 
it, as yet. But most of us insist 
on a limited consideration of it; 
that is, we judge its success or 
failure by the amount of detail 
sent and received. We expect 
facts to be transmitted, words, 
idea sequences — or perhaps pic- 
tures; the clearer the picture, the 
better the telepathy. 

“Perhaps one day we will learn 
to do this; it would be diverting. 
But what we actually do is in- 
finitely more useful. 

“You see, we are telepathic, 
not in the way of conveying de- 
tails, but in the much more useful 
way of conveying a manner of 
thinking. 

“Let us try to envisage a man 
who lacks this quality. Faced 
with your broken machine, he 
would be utterly at a loss, unless 
he had been specially trained in 
this particular field. Do not over- 



look the fact that he lacks the 
conditioning of a whole life of 
the kind of sequence thinking 
which is possible to us. He would 
probably bumble through the 
whole chore in an interminable 
time, trying one thing and then 
another and going forward from 
whatever seems to work. You can 
see the tragic series of pitfalls 
possible for him in a situation in 
which an alternate three or four 
or five consecutive steps are pos- 
sible, forcing step six, which is 
wrong in terms of the problem. 

“Now, take the same man and 
train him in this one job. Add a 
talent, so that he learns quickly 
and well. Add years of experi- 
ence — terrible, drudging thought! 
— to his skill. Face him with the 
repair problem and it is obvious 
that he will repair it with a mini- 
mum of motion. 

“Finally, take this skilled man 
and equip him with a device 
which constantly sends out the 
habit-patterns of his thinking. 
Long practice has made him ef- 
ficient in the matter; in terms of 
machine function he knows bet- 
ter than to question whether a 
part turns this way or that, 
whether a rod or tube larger than 
x diameter is to be considered. 
Furthermore, imagine a receiving 
device which absorbs these send- 
ings whenever the receiver is 
faced with an identical problem. 
The skilled sender controls the 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




unskilled receiver as long as the 
receiver is engaged in the prob- 
lem. Anything the receiver does 
which is counter to the basic 
patterns of the sender is auto- 
matically rejected as illogical. 

“And now I have described our 
species. We have an unmatchable 
unitary existence. Each of us with 
“a natural bent — the poets, the 
musicians, the mechanics, the phi- 
losophers— each gives of his basic 
thinking method every time any- 
one has an application for it. The 
t expert is unaware of being tapped 
— which is why it has taken hun- 
dreds of centuries to recognize the 
method. Yet, in spite of what 
amounts to a veritable race intel- 
lect, we are all very much individ- 
uals. Because each field has many 
experts, and each of those experts 
has his individual approach, only 
that which is closest both to the 
receiver and his problem comes 
in. The ones without special tal- 
ents live fully and richly with all 
the skills of the gifted. The cre- 
ative ones share with others in 
their field as soon as it occurs 
to any expert to review what he 
knows; the one step forward then 
instantly presents itself. 

“CO much for the bulk of our 
^ kind. There remain a few 
specializing non-specialists. When 
you are faced with a problem to 
which no logical solution presents 
itself, you come to one of these 



few for help. The reason no solu- 
tion presents itself is that this is 
a new line of thinking, or (which 
is very* unlikely) the last expert 
in it has died. The non-specialist 
hears your problem and applies 
simple logic to it. Immediately, 
others of his kind do the ■ same. 
But, since they come from wide- 
ly divergent backgrounds and 
use a vast variety of methods, 
one of them is almost certain to ^ 
find the logical solution. This is 
your answer — and through you, 
it is available to anyone who ever 
faces this particular problem. 

“In exceptional cases, the non- 
specializing specialist encounters 
a problem which, for good rea- 
son, is better left out of the racial 
‘pool’ — as, for example, a physi- 
cal or psychological experiment 
within the culture, of long dura- 
tion, which general knowledge 
might alter. In such cases, a high- 
ly specialized hypnotic technique 
is used on the investigators, 
which has the effect of cloaking 
thought on this particular matter. 

“And if you began to fear that 
I was never coming to Osser’s 
unhappy history, you must un- 
derstand, my dear, I have just 
given it to you. Osser was just 
such an experiment. 

“It became desirable to study 
the probable habit patterns of a 
species like us in every respect 
except for our unique attribute. 
The problem was attacked from 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



41 




many angles, but I must confess 
that using a live specimen was 
my idea. 

“By deep hypnosis, the tele- 
pathic receptors in Osser were 
severed from the rest of his mind. 
He was then allowed to grow up 
among us in real and complete 
freedom. 

“You saw the result. Since few 
people recognize the nature of 
this unique talent, and even few- 
er regard it as worth discussion, 
this strong, proud, highly intelli- 
gent boy grew up feeling a hope- 
less inferior, -and never knowing 
exactly wby„ Others did things, 
made things, solved problems, as 
easily as thinking about them, 
while Osser had to study and 
sweat and piece and try out. He 
had to assert his superiority in 
some way. He did, but in as slip- 
shod a fashion as he did every- 
thing else. 

“So he was led to the pictures 
you saw. He was permitted to 
make what conclusions he wished 
— they were that we are a back- 
ward people, incapable of build- 
ing a city. He suddenly saw in 
the dreams of a mechanized, star- 
reaching species a justification of 
himself. He could not understand 
our lack of desire for possessions, 
not knowing that our whole cul- 
tural existence is based on sharing 
— that it is not only undesirable, 
but impossible for us to hoard an 
advanced idea, a new comfort. 



He would master us through 
strength. 

“He was just starting when 
you came to me about him. You 
could get no key to his problem 
because we know nothing about 
sick minds, and there was no ex- 
pert you could tap. I couldn’t 
help you — you, of all people — 
because you loved him, and be- 
cause we dared not risk having 
him know what he was, especial- 
ly when he was just about to 
take action. 

“Why he chose this particular 
site for his tower I do not know. 
And why he chose the method of 
the tower I don’t know either, 
though I can deduce an excellent 
reason. First, he had to use his 
strength once he became con- 
vinced that in it lay his superiori- 
ty. Second, he had to try out 
this build-with-hate idea — the 
bugaboo of all other man-species, 
the trial-and-error, the inability 
to know what will work and what 
will not. 

“And so we learned through 
Osser precisely what we had 
learned in other approaches — 
that a man without our particu- 
lar ability must not live among 
us, for, if he does, he will destroy 
us. 

“It is a small step from that to 
a conclusion about a whole race 
of them coexisting with us. And 
now you know what happened 
here this afternoon.”

J UBILITH raised her head 
slowly. “A whole ship full of 
... of what Osser was?” 

“Yes. We did the only thing 
we could. Quick, quite painless. 
We have been watching them for 
a long time — years. We saw them 
start. We computed their orbit 
— even to the deceleration spiral. 
We chose a spot to launch our 
interceptor.” He glanced at Os- 
ser, who was almost quiet, quite 
exhausted. “What sheer hell he 
must have gone through, to see 
us build like that. How could he 
know that not one of us needed 
training, explanation, or any but 
the simplest orders? How could 
he rationalize to himself our pos- 
session of machines and devices 
surpassing the wildest dreams of 
the godlike men he admired so? 
How could he understand that, 
having such things, we use them 
only when we must, and that 
otherwise we live in ways which 
will not violate the walking, 
working animal we are?” 

She turned to him a mask so 
cold, so beautiful, he forgot for a 
moment to breathe. “Why did 
you do it? You had other logics, 
other approaches. Did you have 
to do that to him?” 

He studiously avoided a glance 
at Osser. “I said you might hate 
me,” he murmured. “Jubilith, the 
men in that ship were so like 
Osser that the experiment could 
not be passed by. We had astro- 



nomical data, historical, cultural 
— as far as our observations could 
go — and ethnological. But only 
by analogy could we get such a 
psychological study. And it 
checked too well. As for having 
him see this thing, today . 
building, Jubilith, is sometimes 
begun by tearing down.” 

He looked at her with deep 
compassion. “This was not the 
site chosen for the launching of 
the interceptor. We uprooted the 
whole installation, brought it 
here, rebuilt it, just for Osser; 
just so that he could stand on his 
tower and see it happen. He had 
to be broken, leveled to the earth. 
Ah-h-h . .” he breathed pain- 
fully, “Osser has earned what he 
will have from now on.” 

“He can be — well again?” 
“With your help.” 

“So very right, you are,” she 
snarled suddenly. “So sure that 
this or that species is fit to asso- 
ciate with superiors like us.” She 
leaned toward him and shook a 
finger in his startled face. The 
courtly awe habitual to all when 
speaking to such as Wrenn had 
completely left her. 

“So fine we are, so mighty. And 
didn’t we build cities? Didn’t we 
have giant bird-machines and 
shiny carts on our streets? Didn’t 
we let our cities be smashed — 
haven’t you seen the ruins in the 
west? Tell me,” she sparked, “did 
we ruin them ourselves, because

one superior city insisted on prov- 
ing its superiority over another 
superior city?” 

S HE stopped abruptly to keep 
herself from growling like an 
animal, for he was smiling bland- 
ly, and his smile got wider as she 
spoke. She turned furiously, half 
away from him, cursing the brok- 
en knee that held her so helpless. 
“Jubilith.” 

His voice was so warm, so kind 
and so startling in these sur- 
roundings, held such a bubbling 
overtone of laughter that she 
couldn’t reis'ist it. She turned 
grudgingly. 

In his hand he held a pebble. 
When her eye fell to it he rolled 
it, held it between thumb and 
forefinger, and let it go. 

It stayed motionless in mid- 
air. “Another factor, Jubilith.” 
She almost smiled. She looked 
down at his other hand, and saw 
it aiming the disc-shaped force- 
field projector at low power. 

He lifted it and, with the field, 
tossed the pebble into the air and 
batted it away. “We have no 
written history, Jubilith. We 
don’t need one, but once in a 
while it would be useful. 

“Jubilith, our culture is one of 
the oldest in the Galaxy. If we 
ever had such cities, there are 
not even legends about it.” 

“But I saw—” 

“A ship came here once. We 



had never seen a humanoid race. 
We welcomed them and helped 
them. We gave them land and 
seeds: Then they called a flotilla, 
and the ships came by the hun- 
dreds. 

“They built cities and, at that, 
we moved away and left them 
alone, because we don’t need 
cities. Then they began to hate 
us. They couldn’t hate us until 
they had tall buildings to do it 
in. They hated our quiet; they 
hated our understanding. They 
sent missionaries to change our 
ways. We welcomed the mission- 
aries, fed them and laughed with 
them, but when they left us 
glittering tools and humble ma- 
chines to amuse us, we let them 
lie where they were until they 
rotted. 

“In time they sent no more 
missionaries. They joked about 
us and forgot us. And then they 
built a city on land we had not 
given them, and another, and an- 
other. They bred well, and their 
cities became infernally big. And 
finally they began to build that 
one city too many, and we turned 
a river and drowned it. They were 
pleased. They could now rid 
themselves of the backward na- 
tives.” 

J UBILITH closed her eyes, and 
saw the tumbled agony of the 
mounds, radiating outward from 
a lake with its shores too bare.

“All of them?” she asked. 

Wrenn nodded. “Even one 
might be enough to destroy us.” 
He nodded toward Osser, who 
had begun to cry again. 

“They seemed . good,” she 
said, reflectively. “Too fast, too 
big . and it must have been 
noisy, but — ” 

“Wait,” he said. “You mean the 
people in the picture Osser 
showed you?” 

“Of course. They were the city- 
builders you — we — destroyed, 
weren’t they?” 

“They were not! The ones who 
built here were thin, hairy, with" 
backward-slanting faces andwebs 
between their fingers. Beautiful, 
but they hated us . The pic- 
tures, Jubilith, were made on the 
third planet of a pale star out 
near the Rim; a world with one 
Moon; a world of humans like 
Osser . the world where that 
golden ship came from.” 

“How?” she gasped. 

“If logic is good enough,” 
WrCnn said, “it need not be 
checked. Once we were so treated 
by humanoids, we built the in- 
vestigators. They are not manned. 
They draw their power from any- 
thing that radiates, and they 
home on any planet which could 
conceivably rear humans. They 
are, as far as we know, inde- 
fectible. We’ve never lost one. 
They launch tiny flyers to make 
close searches — one of them made 



the pictures you saw. The pic- 
tures and other data are coded 
and sent out into space and, 
where distances warrant it, other 
investigators catch the signal and 
add power and send them on. 

“Whenever a human or human- 
oid species builds a ship, we 
watch it. When they send their 
ships to this sector, we watch 
their planet and their ship. Un- 
less we are sure that those people 
have the ability we have, to share 
all expertness and all creative 
thinking with all who want it — 
they don’t land here. And no 
such species ever will land here.” 
“You’re so sure.” 

“We explore no planets, Jubi- 
lith. We like it here. If others 
like us exist — why should they 
visit us?” 

She thought about it, and slow- 
ly she nodded. “I like it here,” 
she breathed. 

W RENN knelt and looked out 
across the rolling ground. It 
was late, and most of the vil- 
lagers had gone home. A few 
picked at the mound of splinters 
at the implosion center. Their 
limbs were straight and their faces 
clear. They owned little and they 
shared their souls. 

He rose and went to Osser, and 
sat down beside him, facing him, 
his back to Jubilith. “M-m-mum, 
mum, mum, mum, mum-mum- 
mum,” he intoned. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



45 




Osser blinked at him. Wrenn 
lifted his hand and his ring, green 
and gold and a shimmering oval 
of purple, caught the late light. 
Osser looked at the ring. He 
reached for it. Wrenn moved it 
slightly. Osser’s hand passed it 
and hit the ground and lay there 
neglected. Osser gaped at the ring, 
his jaws working, his teeth not 
meeting. 

“Mum, mum, mummy, where’s 
your mummy, Osser?” 

“In the house,” said Osser, 
looking at the ring. 

Wrenn said, “You’re a good 
little boy. When we say the word, 
you won’t be able to do any- 
thing but what you can do. When 
we say -the key, you’ll be able 
to do anything anybody can do.” 
“All right,” Osser said. 

“Before I give the word, tell me 
the key. You must remember the 
key.” 

“That ring. And ‘last ’n’ lost.’ ” 
"Good, Osser. Now listen to me. 
Can you hear me?” 

“Sure.” He grabbed at the ring. 
“I’m going to change the key. 
It isn’t ‘last ’n’ lost’ any more. 
‘Last ’n’ lost’ is no good now. 
Forget it.” 

“No good?” 

“Forget it. What’s the key?” 

“I — forgot.” 

“The key,” said Wrenn patient- 
ly, “is this.” He leaned close' and 
whispered rapidly. 

Jubilith was peering out past 



the implosion center to the town- 
ward path. Someone was coming, 
a tiny figure. 

“Judilith,” Wrenn said. She 
looked up at him. “You must 
understand something.” His voice 
was grave. His hair reached for 
an awed little twist of wind, come 
miles to see this place: The wind 
escaped and ran away down the 
hill. 

Wrenn said, “He’s very happy 
now. He was a happy child when 
first I heard of him, and how like 
a spacebound human he could be. 
Well, he’s that child again. He 
always will be, until the day he 
dies. I’ll see he’s cared for. He’ll 
chase the sunbeams, a velvet red 
one and a needle of blue-white; 
he’ll eat and he’ll love and be 
loved just as is right for him.” 

They looked at Osser. There 
was a blue insect on his wrist. 
He raised it slowly, slowly, close 
to his eyes, and through its gauze 
wings he saw the flame-and-silver 
sunset. He laughed. 

“All his life?” 

“All his life,” said Wrenn. 
“With the bitterness and the 
trouble wiped away, and no 
chance to mature again into the 
unfinished thing that fought the 
world with the conviction it had 
something extra.” 

Then he dropped the ring into 
Jubilith’s hand. “But if you care 
to,” he said, watching her face, 
the responsive motion of her sen- 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




sitive nostrils, the most delicate 
index of her lower lip, “if you 
care to, you' can give him back 
everything I took away. In a 
moment, you can give him more 
than he has now; but how long 
would it take you to make him 
as happy?” 

She made no attempt to answer 
him. He was Wrenn, he was old 
and wise; he was a member of a 
unique species whose resources 
were incalculable; and yet he 
was asking her to do something 
he could not do himself. Perhaps 
he was asking her to correct a 
wrong. She would never know 
that. 

“Just the ring,” he said, “and 
the touch of your hand.” 

He went away, straight and 
tall, quickening his pace as, far 
away, the patient figure she had 
been watching earlier rose and 
came to meet him. It was Oyva. 

Jubilith thought, “He needs 
her.” 

Jubilith had never been needed 
by anyone. 

She looked at her hand and 
in it she saw all she was, all she 
could ever be in her own right; 
and with it, the music of ages; 



never the words, but all of the- 
pressures of poetry. And she saw 
the extraordinary privacy of love 
in a world which looked out 
through her eyes, placed all of its 
skills in her hands, to do with 
as she alone wished. 

With a touch of her hand . 
what a flood of sensation, what 
a bursting in of voices and knowl- 
edge, for a child! 

How long a child? 

She closed her eyes, and quietly 
the answer came, full of pictures; 
the lute picked up and played; 
the instant familiarity with the 
most intricate machine; the stars 
seen otherwise, and yet . again 
otherwise, and every seeing an 
honest beauty. A thousand dis- 
coveries, and manhood with a 
rush. 

She slipped the ring on her 
finger, and dragged herself over 
to him. She put her arms around 
him and his cheek came down to 
the hollow of her throat and bur- 
rowed there. 

He said, sleepily, “Is it night- 
time, Mummy?” 

“For just a little while,” said 
Jubilith.

An invalid may occupy his days 
by dreaming of a better world; 
but what about his nightmares? 

C HARLEY PORTER is a butcher and a mighty tide of 
copyreader on the Daily judgment set against the news. 
Times and a copyreader He’s a sort of cross between a

48 GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







Occasionally you meet a re- 
porter or an editor or you see 
their pictures or you hear them 
spoken of. But you never hear 
about a copyreader. 

The copyreader sits with his 
fellow copyreaders at a horse- 
shoe-shaped table. If he’s an old 
time copyreader, like Charley is, 
he wears a green eyeshade and 
rolls his shirtsleeves up above 
his elbows. 

Inside the curve of the copy- 
desk sits the man who directs the 
copyreaders. Since the inside of 
the desk is known as the slot, this 
man is called the slot man. To 
the slot man comes the daily flow 
of news; he passes the copy to 
the men around the desk and 
they edit it and write the head- 
lines. 

i Because there is always copy 
| enough to fill twenty times the 
allotted space, the copyreader 
must trim all the stories and see 
there is no excess wordage in 
them. This brings him into con- 

I tinuous collision with reporters, 
who see their ornately worded 
stories come out chopped and 
mangled, although definitely 
more readable. 

When work slacks off in the 
afternoon, the copyreaders break 
their silence and talk among 
themselves! They talk about the 
news and debate what can be 
done about it. If you listened to 
them, not knowing who they 



were, you’d swear you were lis- 
tening in on some world com- 
mission ’ faced by weighty 
problems on which life or death 
depended. 

For your copyreader is a wor- 
rier. He worries because each day 
he handles the fresh and bleeding 
incidents that shape the course of 
human destiny, and there prob- 
ably is no one who knows more 
surely nor feels more keenly the 
knife-edge balance between sur- 
vival and disaster. 

C HARLEY PORTER worried 
more than most. He worried 
about a lot of things that didn’t 
seem to call for worry. 

There was the matter, for in- 
stance, of those “impossible” 
stories happening in sequence. 
The other men on the copydesk 
took notice of them after two or 
three had occurred, and talked 
about them — among themselves, 
naturally, for no proper copy- 
reader ever talks to anyone but 
another copyreader. But they 
passed them off with only casual 
mention. 

Charley worried about the in- 
cidents, secretly, of course, since 
he could see that none of his fel- 
low copyreaders felt them worthy 
of really serious worry. After he 
had done a lot of worrying, he 
began to see some similarity 
among them, and that was when 
he really got down on the floor 



WORRY WART

and wrestled with himself. 

First there had been the air- 
liner downed out in Utah. Bad 
weather held up the hunt for it, 
but finally air searchers spotted 
the wreckage strewn over half- 
a mountain peak. Airline officials 
said there was no hope that any 
had survived. But when the res- 
cuers were halfway to the wreck- 
age, they met the survivors 
walking out; every single soul 
had lived through the crash. 

Then there was the matter of 
Midnight, the 64 to 1 shot, win- 
ning the Derby. 

And, after that, the case of 
the little girl who didn’t have a 
chance of getting well. They held 
a party for her weeks ahead of 
time so she could have a final 
birthday. Her picture was pub- 
lished coast to coast and the 
stories about her made you want 
to cry and thousands of people 
sent her gifts and postcards. 
Then, suddenly, she got well. Not 
from any new wonder drug or 
from any new medical technique. 
She just got well, some time in 
the night. 

A few days later the wires car- 
ried the story about old Pal, the 
coon dog down in Kentucky who 
got trapped inside a cave. Men 
dug for days and yelled encour- 
agement. The old dog whined 
back at them, but finally he 
didn’t whine any more and the 
digging was getting mighty hard. 



So the men heaped boulders into 
the hole they’d dug and built a 
cairn. They said pious, angry, 
hopeless words, then went back 
to their cabins and their plowing. 

The next day old Pal came 
home. He was a walking rack of 
bones, but he still could wag 
his tail. The way he went through 
a bowl of milk made a man feel 
good just to see him do it. Every- 
one agreed that old Pal must 
finally have found a way to get 
out by himself. 

Except that an old dog buried 
in a cave for days, getting weaker 
all the time from lack of food 
and water, doesn’t find a way to 
get out by himself. 

And little dying, girls don’t get 
well, just like that, in the middle 
of the night. 

And 64 to 1 shots don’t win the 
Derby. 

And planes don’t shatter them- 
selves among the Utah peaks 
with no one getting hurt at all. 

A miracle, sure. Two miracles, 
even. But not four in a row and 
within a few weeks of one an- 
other. 

I T took Charley quite a while 
to establish some line of simi- 
larity. When he did, it was a 
fairly thin line. But thick enough, 
at least, to justify more worry. 

The line of similarity was this: 
All the stories were “running” or 
developing stories. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



50 




There had been a stretch of 
two days during which the world 
waited for the facts of the plane 
crash. It had been known for 
days bfefore the race that Mid- 
night would run and that he 
didn’t have a chance. The story of 
the doomed little girl had been 
a matter of public interest for 
weeks. The old coon dog had 
been in the cave a week or more 
before the men gave up and went 
back to their homes. 

In each of the stories, the re- 
sult was not known until some 
time after the situation itself 
was known. Until the final fact 
was actually determined, there 
existed an infinite number of 
probabilities, some more probable 
than others, but with each prob- 
ability’s having at least a fighting 
chance. When you flip a dime in- 
ter the air, there always exists 
the infinitesimal probability, 
from the moment you flip it until 
it finally lands heads or tails, 
that it will land on edge and stay 
there. Until the fact that it is 
heads or tails is established, the 
probability of its landing on edge 
continues to remain. 

And that was exactly what had 
happened, Charley told himself: 

The dime had been flipped four 
times, and four times running it 
had stood on edge. 

There was one minor dissimil- 
arity, of course . the plane 
crash. It didn’t quite fit. 



Each event had been a spin of 
the dime, and while that dime 
was still in air, and the public 
held its breath, a little girl had 
gotten well, somehow, and a dog 
had escaped from a cave, some- 
how, and a 64 to 1 shot had de- 
veloped whatever short-lived 
properties bf physique and temp- 
erament are necessary to make 
long shots win. 

But the plane crash — there had 
been no thought of it until after 
the fact. By the time the crash 
came into the public eye, the 
dime was down, and what had 
happened on that mountain peak 
had already happened, and all 
the hopes and prayers offered for 
the safety of the passengers were, 
actually, retroactive in the face 
of the enormous probability that 
all had perished. 

Please, let the dog escape. To- 
night. 

Let the little girl get well. Soon. 

Let my long shot come in. Next 
week. 

Let the passengers be alive. 
Since yesterday. 

Somehow the plane crash wor- 
ried Charley most of all. 

7T1HEN, to everyone’s surprise, 
■*- and with no logic whatsoever, 
the Iranian situation cleared up, 
just when it began to look as if 
it might be another Korea. 

A few days later Britain an- 
nounced, proudly that it had 



weathered its monetary storm, 
that all was well with the sterling 
bloc, and London would need no 
further loans. 

It took a while for Charley to 
tie these two stories up with the 
plane-girl-Derby-hound-dog se- 
quence. But then he saw that 
they belonged and that was when 
he remembered something else 
that might — well, not tie" in, ex- 
actly — but might have something 
to do with this extraordinary run 
of impossibilities. 

After work, he went down to 
the Associated Press office and 
had an office boy haul out the 
files, stapled books of carboned 
flimsies — white flimsies for the A 
wire, blue flimsies for the B wire, 
yellow for the sports wire and 
pink for the market wire. He 
knew what he was looking for 
hadn’t come over either the mar- 
ket or the sports wire, so he pass- 
ed them up and went through the 
A and B wire sheets story by 
story. 

He couldn’t remember the ex- 
act date the story had come over, 
but he knew it had been since 
Memorial Day, so he started 
with the day after Memorial 
Day and worked forward. 

He remembered the incident 
clearly. Jensen, the slot man, had 
picked it up and read it through. 
Then he had laughed and put it 
on the spike. 

One of the others asked : 



“What was funny, Jens?” 

So Jensen took the story off 
the spike and threw it over to 
him. It- had gone the rounds of 
the desk, with each man heading | 
it, and finally it had got back on | 
the spike again. * 

And that had been the last of 
it. For the story was too wacky 
for any newsman to give & second 
glance. It had all the earmarks | 
of the phony. f 

Charley didn’t find what he 
was looking for the first day, al- 
though he worked well into the 
evening — so he went back the 
next afternoon, and found it. 

It was out of a little resort 
town up in Wisconsin, and it 
told about an invalid named 
Cooper Jackson who had been 
bedridden since he was two or 
three years old. The story said 
that Cooper’s old man claimed 
that Cooper could foresee things, 
that he would think of something 
or imagine something during the 
evening and the next day it 
would happen. Things like Line 
Abrams’ driving his car into the 
culvert at Trout Run and coming 
out all right himself, but with the 
car all smashed to . flinders, and 
like the Reverend Amos Tucker’s 
getting a letter from a brother he 
hadn’t heard from in more than 
twenty years. 

The next day Charley spoke to 
Jensen. 

“I got a few days coming,” he 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said, “from that time I worked 
six-day weeks last fall, and I 
still got a week of last year’s 
vacation you couldn’t find the 
room for . 

“Sure, Charley,” Jensen said. 
“We’re in good shape right now.” 

rpWO days later Charley step- 
ped off the milk-run train in 
the little resort town in Wiscon- 
sin. He went to one of the several 
cabin camps’ down on- the lake 
that fronted the town and got 
himself a small, miserable cabin 
for which he paid an exorbitant 
price. And it wasn’t until then 
that he dared let himself think — 
really think — of the reason he 
had come there. 

In the evening he went uptown 
and spent an hour or two stand- 
ing around in the general store 
and the pool room. He came back 
with the information that he had 
set out for, and another piece of 
information he had not been pre- 
pared to hear. 

The first piece of information, 
the one he had gone out to get, 
was that Dr. Erik Ames was the 
man to see. Doc Ames, it appear- 
ed, was not only the doctor and 
the mayor of the town, but the 
acknowledged civic leader, sage 
and father confessor of the whole 
community. 

The second piece of informa- 
tion, one which had served the 
town as a conversation piece for 



the last two .months, was that 
Cooper Jackson, after years of 
keeping to his bed as a helpless 
invalid, now was ’ on his feet. He 
had to use a cane, of course, but 
he got around real well and every 
day h% took a walk down by the 
lake. 

They hadn’t said what time of 
day, so Charley was up early in 
the morning and started walk- 
ing up and down the lakeshore, 
keeping a good lookout. He talk- 
ed with the tourists who occupied 
the other cabins and he talked 
with men who were setting out 
for a day of fishing. He spent 
considerable time observing a 
yellow-winged blackbird that 
had its nest somewhere in a 
bunch of rushes on a marshy spit. 

Cooper Jackson finally came 
early in the afternoon, hobbling 
along on his cane, with a peaked 
look about him. He walked along 
the shore for a ways; then sat 
down to rest on a length of old 
dead tree that had been tossed 
up by a storm. 

Charley ambled over. “Do you 
mind?” he asked, sitting down 
beside him. 

“Not at all,” said Cooper Jack- 
son. “I’m glad to have you.” 

They talked. Charley told him 
how he was a newspaperman up 
there for a short vacation and 
how it was good to get away from 
the kind of news that came over 
the teletypes, and how he envied 



WORRYWART 



53 



the people who could live in this 
country all the year around. 

When he heard Charley was a 
newspaperman, Cooper’s interest 
picked up like a hound dog cock- 
ing its ears. He began to a.sk all 
sorts of questions, the kind of 
questions that everyone asks a 
newspaperman whenever he can 
corner one. 

What do you think of the situ- 
ation and what can be done 
about it and is there any chance 
of preventing war and what 
should we do to prevent a war . 
and so on until you think you’ll 
scream. 

Except that it seemed to Char- 
ley that Cooper’s questions were 
a bit more incisive, backed by a 
bit more information than were 
the questions of the ordinary 
person. He seemed to display 
more insistence and urgency than 
the ordinary person, who always 
asked his questions in a rather 
detached, academic way. 

Charley told him, honestly 
enough, that he didn’t know what 
could be done to prevent a war, 
although he said that the quieting 
of the Iranian situation and the 
British monetary announcement 
might go a long way toward 
keeping war from happening. 

“You know,” said Cooper 
Jackson, “I felt the same way, 
too. That is, after I read the 
news, I felt that those were two 
good things to happen.” 



A T this point, perhaps, a 
couple of things should be 
considered. 

If Charley Porter had been a 
regular newspaperman instead of 
of copyreader, he might have 
mentioned the plane wreck and 
the little girl who hadn’t died, 
and how it was a funny thing 
about that coon dog getting out 
of the cave and how he knew of 
a man who’d made a mint of 
money riding in on Midnight. 

But Charley didn’t say these 
things. 

If Charley had been a regular 
newspaperman, he might have 
said to Cooper Jackson: “Look 
here, kid, I’m on to you. I know 
what you’re doing. I got it figured 
out. Maybe you better straighten 
me out on a point or two, so I’ll 
have the story right.” 

But Charley didn’t say this. 
Instead he said that he had heard 
uptown the night before about 
Cooper’s miraculous recovery, 
and he was Cooper Jackson, 
wasn’t he? 

Yes, Cooper answered, he was 
Cooper Jackson, and perhaps his 
recovery was miraculous. No, he 
said, he didn’t have the least idea 
of how it came about and Doc 
Ames didn’t either. 

They parted after an hour or 
two of talk. Charley didn’t say 
anything about seeing him again. 
But the next day -Cooper came 
limping down to the beach and 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



headed for the log, and Charley 
was waiting for him. 

That was the day Cooper gave 
Charley his case history. He had 
been an invalid, he said, from as 
far back as he could remember, 
although his mother had told 
him it hadn’t happened until he 
was three years old. 

He liked to listen to stories, 
and the stories that his parents 
and his brothers and sisters told, 
him and read to him were what 
had kept him alive, he was cer- 
tain, during those first years. For 
he made the stories work for him. 

He told how he made the char- 
acters — Peter Rabbit and the 
Gingerbread Man and Little Bo 
Peep and all the rest of them — 
keep on working overtime after 
he had heard the stories. He 
would lie in bed, he said, and 
relive the stories over and over 
again. 

“But after a while, those stories 
got pretty threadbare. So I im- 
proved on them. I invented 
stories. I mixed up the charac- 
ters. For some reason or other 
Peter Rabbit and the Ginger- 
bread Man always were my 
heroes. They would go on the 
strangest odysseys and meet all 
these other characters, and to- 
gether they would have adven- 
tures that were plain impossible. 

“Except,” he added, “they 
never seemed impossible to me.” 

Finally he had got to be the 



age where kids usually start off to 
school. Cooper’s Ma had begun 
to worry about what they should 
do for his education. But Doc 
Ames, who was fairly sure Coop- 
er wouldn’t live long enough for 
an education to do him any good, 
had advised that they teach him 
whatever he might be interested 
in learning. It turned out that 
about all Cooper was interested 
in was reading. So they taught 
him how to read. Now he didn’t 
have to have anyone read him 
stories any more, but could read 
them for himself. He read Tom 
Sawyer and Huck Finn and 
Lewis Carroll’s works and a lot 
of other books. 

So now Jie had more charac- 
ters, and Peter Rabbit had some 
rather horrible moments recon- 
ciling his world with the world 
of Tweedledum and Tweedledee 
and the Mock Turtle. But he 
finally worked in, and the im- 
agined adventuring got crazier 
and crazier. 

“It’s a wonder,” said Cooper 
Jackson, “that I didn’t die laugh- 
ing. But to me it wasn’t funny. 
It was dead serious.” 

“What do you read now, Coop- 
er?” Charley asked. 

“Oh, the newspapers,” Cooper 
said, “and the news magazines 
and stuff like that.” 

“That’s not what I mean,” 
Charley explained. “What do you 
read for relaxation? What takes 



WORRYWAR1

the place of Peter Rabbit?” 

Cooper hemmed and hawed a 
little and finally he admitted it. 

“I read science fiction. I ran 
onto it when someone brought 
hie a magazine six or seven years 
ago ... no, I guess it’s more like 
eight.” 

“I read the stuff myself,” said 
Charley, to put him at his ease. 

So they sat the rest of the 
afternoon and talked of science 
fiction. 

npHAT night Charley Porter lay 
-*• in his bed in the little lake- 
shore cabin, staring into the dark- 
ness, trying to understand how 
it must have been for Cooper 
Jackson, lying there all those 
years, living with the characters 
out of children’s books and later 
out of boys’ books and then out 
of science fiction. 

He had said that he’d never 
been in much pain, but some- 
times the nights were long and 
it was hard to sleep, and that was 
how he’d got started with his im- 
agining. He would imagine things 
to occupy his mind. 

At first, it was just a mental 
exercise, saying such and such 
a thing is happening now and 
going on from there to some 
other thing that was happening. 
But after a while he began to 
see an actual set of characters 
acting on an imaginary stage, 
faint and fuzzy characters going 



through their parts. They were 
nebulous at first; later on, they 
became gray, like little skipping 
ghosts; then they had achieved 
the sharpness of black and white. 
About the time he began to deal 
with Tom Sawyer and Robinson 
Crusoe, the characters and back- 
grounds had begun to take on 
color and perspective. 

And from Huck Finn and Rob- 
inson Crusoe and Swiss Family 
Robinson, he had gone on to sci- 
ence fiction. 

Good Lord, thought Charley 
Porter. He went on to science 
fiction. 

Take an invalid who had never 
moved out of his bed, who had 
never had a formal education, 
who knew little and cared less 
about the human viewpoint, give 
him an overwrought imagination 
and turn him loose on science 
fiction — and what have you got? 

Charley lay there in the dark- 
ness and tried to put himself in- 
to the place of Cooper Jackson. 
He tried to imagine what Cooper 
might have imagined, what far 
adventuring he might have em- 
barked upon. 

Then let the same invalid sud- 
denly become aware of the world 
around him, as Cooper had — for 
now he read the newspapers and 
the news magazines. Let him see 
what kind of shape the world 
was in. 

What might happen then?

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




You're crazy, Charley told 
himself. But he lay for a long 
time, looking up into the black, 
before he went to sleep. 

j OOPER seemed to like him, 
^ and they spent a part of each 
day together. They talked about 
science fiction and the news of 
the day and what should be done 
to ensure world peace. Charley 
told him he didn’t know what 
should be done, that a lot of 
men much smarter than he were 
working full time on it, and they 
had found no answer yet. 

“Someone,” said Cooper, “must 
do something about it.” And the 
way he said it, you would have 
sworn that he was going to set 
out any minute to do that very 
thing. 

So Charley went to call on old 
Doc Ames. 

“I’ve heard of you,” the doc- 
tor told him. “Coop was telling 
me about you just the other 
day.” 

“I’ve been spending a little 
time with Cooper,” Charley said, 
“and I’ve wanted to ask him 
something, but I haven’t done 
it.” 

“I know. You wanted to ask 
him about the story that was in 
the papers here a few months 
back.” 

“That’s right,” Charley agreed. 
“And I wanted to ask him, too, 
about how he got up and walked 



after all those years in bed.” 
“You’re looking for a story?” 
asked the doctor. 

“No,” said Charley, “I’m not 
looking for a story.” 

“You’re a newspaperman.” 

“I came for a story,” Charley 
told him. “But not any more. 
Right now I’m . well, I’m sort 
of scared.” 

“So am I.” 

“If what I’m thinking is right, 
it’s too big to be a story.” 

“I hope,” said Doc, “that both 
of us are wrong.” 

“He’s hell bent,” Charley went 
on, “to bring peace to the world. 
He’s asked me about it a dozen 
times in a dozen different ways. 
I’ve told him I don’t know, and 
I don’t think there’s anyone who 
does.” 

“That’s the trouble. If he’d just 
stick to things like that lost plane 
out in Utah and the hound dog 
down in Kentucky, it might be 
all right.” 

“Did he tell you about those 
things, Doc?” 

“No,” said Doc, “he didn’t 
really tell me. But he said 
wouldn’t it be fine if all those 
people in the plane should be 
found alive, and he did a lot of 
fretting about that poor trapped 
dog. He likes animals.” 

“I figure he just practiced up 
on a few small items,” Charley 
suggested, “to find if he could 
do it. He’s out for big game now.”

Then good, solid, common 
sense came back to him and he 
said : “But, of course, it isn’t pos- 
sible.” 

“He’s got help,” said Doc. 
“Hasn’t he told you about the 
help he’s got?” 

Charley shook his head. 

“He doesn’t know you well 
enough. I’m the only one he 
knows well enough to tell a thing 
like that.” 

“He’s got help? You mean 
someone’s helping . ?” 

“Not someone,” said Doc. 
“Something.” 

T HEN Doc told Charley what 
Cooper had told him. 

It had started four or five years 
before, shortly after he’d gone on 
his science fiction binge. He’d 
built himself an imaginary ship 
that he took out into space. First 
he’d traveled around our own 
Solar System — to Mars and 
Venus and all the others. Then, 
tiring of such backyard stuff, he 
had built iri a gadget that gave 
his ship speed in excess of light 
and had gone out to the stars. 
He was systematic about it; you 
had to say that much for him. 
He worked things out logically, 
and he didn’t skip around. He’d 
land on a certain planet and give 
that planet the full treatment be- 
fore he went on to the next one. 

Somewhere along the way, he 
picked himself up a crew of com- 



panions, most of which were only 
faintly humanoid, if at all. 

And all the time this space- 
world, this star-world, got clearer 
and sharper and more real. It 
almost got to the point where he 
lived in its reality rather than in 
the reality of the here and now. 

The realization that someone 
else had joined him, that he had 
picked up from somewhere a col- 
laborator in his fantasies, began 
first as a suspicion, finally solidi- 
fied into certainty. The fantasies 
got into the habit of not going as 
he himself was imagining them; 
they were modified, and added 
to, and changed in other ways. 
Cooper didn’t mind though, for 
generally they were better than 
anything he could think up by 
himself — and finally he had 
grown to know his collaborators 
— not one of them alone, but 
three of them, each a separate en- 
tity. After the first shocks of rec- 
ognition, the four them got along 
just swell. 

“You mean he knows these 
others — these helpers?” 

“He knows them all right,” said 
Doc. “Which doesn’t mean, of 
course, that he has ever seen 
them or will ever see them.” 
“You believe this, Doc?” 

“I don’t know. I don’t know. 
But I do know Coop, and I know 
that he got up and walked. There 
is no medical science ... no hu- 
man medical science . that 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




would have made him walk.” 
“You think these helpers, these 
collaborators of his, might some- 
how have cured him?” 
“Something did.” 

“One thing haunts me,” said 
Charley. “Is Cooper Jackson 
sane?” • S 

“Probably,” answered Doc, 
“he’s the sanest man on Earth.” 
“And the most dangerous.” 
“That’s what worries me. I 
watch him the best I can. I see 
him every day . .” 

“How many others have you 
told?” asked Charley. 

“Not a soul,” said Doc. 

“How many are you going to 
tell?” 

“None. Probably I shouldn’t 
have told you, but you already 
knew part of it. What are you 
going to do?” 

“I’m going home,” said Char- 
ley. “I’m going to go home and 
keep my mouth shut.” 

“Nothing else?” 

“Nothing else. If I were a pray- 
ing man, I think I’d do some 
praying.” 

H E went home and kept his 
mouth shut and did a lot of 
worrying. He wondered whether, 
praying man or not, he shouldn’t 
try a prayer or two. But when 
he did, the prayers sounded 
strange and out of place coming 
from his lips, so he figured he’d 
better leave well enough atone. 



At times it still seemed im- 
possible. At other times it seemed 
crystal clear that Cooper Jack- . 
son actually could will an event 
to happen — that by thinking so, 
he could make it so. But mostly, 
because he knew too much to 
think otherwise, Charley knew 
that the whole thing was true. 
Cooper Jackson had spent twenty 
years or so in thinking and imag- 
ining, his thoughts and imagin- 
ings shaped, not by the course of 
human events, but by the fan- 
tasy of many human minds. He 
would not think as a normal hu- 
man being thought, and therein 
lay both an advantage and a dan- 
ger. 

If he did not think in entirely 
human channels, he also was not 
trammeled by the limitations of 
human thinking; he was free to 
let his mind wander out in strange 
directions and bend its energies 
to strange tasks. His obsession 
with the necessity of achieving 
lasting peace was an example of 
his unhuman attitude; for, while 
the entire Earth did earnest lip 
service to the cause of peace, the 
threat of war had hung over every 
one so long that its horror had 
been dulled. But to Cooper Jack- 
son, it was unthinkable that men 
should slay one another by the 
millions. 

Always Charley came back to 
those helpers, those three shad- 
owy figures he pictured as stand- 



WORRY WART 



59 




ing at Cooper Jackson’s shoulder. 
He assigned them three arbitrary 
faces, but the faces would not 
stay as he imagined them. At last 
he understood that, they were 
things to which you could assign 
no face. 

But the thing that he still wor- 
ried most about, although he tried 
not to thinfc of it at all because 
of its enormity, was the Utah 
plane crash. 

The plane had crashed before 
Cooper, or anyone else, could 
have known it was about to crash. 
Whatever had happened to the 
people in the plane had happened 
then, in that one split second 
when plane and peak had touched 
— had happened without benefit 
of the magic of Cooper Jackson’s 
wishful thinking. And to imagine 
that, without such benefit, the 
passengers and crew could have 
escaped unscathed was nothing 
short of madness. It just couldn’t 
have happened that way. 

And that meant that Cooper 
not only could make something 
turn out the way he wanted it to 
turn out, but that he also could 
go back through time and undo 
something that was already done! 
Either that, or he could bring' 
dead people back to life, reas- 
sembling their shattered bodies 
and making them whole again, 
and that was even madder than 
to think that his wishful thinking 
might be retroactive. 



W HENEVER Charley thought 
about that, the sweat would 
start out on him and he’d think 
about Britain and Iran and once 
again he would see Cooper’s fqce, 
all puckered up with worry about 
wfiat the world was coming to. 

He watched the news more 
closely than he had ever watched 
it, analyzing each unexpected 
turn in it, searching for the clue 
that might suggest some hare- 
brained scheme to Cooper Jack- 
son, trying to think the way 
Cooper might think, but feeling 
fairly sure that he wasn’t even 
coming close. 

He had his bags packed twice 
to go to Washington — but each 
time he unpacked them and put 
away his clothes and shoved the 
bags back into the closet. 

For he realized there was no 
use going to Washington, or any- 
where else for that matter. 

“Mr. President, I know a man 
who can bring peace to the 
world . .” 

They’d throw him out before 
he had the sentence finished. 

He called Doc Ames, and Doc 
told him that everything was all 
right, that Cooper had bought a 
lot of back-issue science fiction 
magazines and was going through 
them, cataloguing story themes 
and variant ideas. He seemed 
happy in this pastime and calmer 
than he’d been for weeks. 

When Charley hung up, he 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




found that his hands were shak- 
ing and he suddenly was cold 
all over, for he felt positive that 
he knew what Cooper was doing 
with those piles of magazines. 

He sat in the one comfortable 
chair in his rented room and 
thought furiously, turning over 
and over the plots that he had 
run across in his science fiction 
reading. While there were some 
that might apply, he rejected 
them because they didn’t fit into 
the pattern of his fear. 

It wasri’t until then that he re- 
alized he’d been so busy worry- 
ing about Cooper that he hadn’t 
been paying attention to the re- 
cent magazines. Cold fear grip- 
ped him that there might be 
something in the current issues 
that might apply most neatly. 

He’d have to buy all the maga- 
zines he could find, and give them 
a good, fast check. 

T>UT he got busy at one thing 
and another and it was al- 
most a week before he got around 
to buying them. By that time 
his fear had subsided to some ex- 
tent. Trudging home with the 
magazines clutched beneath his 
arm, he decided that he would 
put aside his worry for one night 
at least and read for enjoyment. 

That evening he settled him- 
self in the comfortable chair and 
stacked the magazines beside 
him. He took the first one off 



the top of the stack and opened 
it, noting with some pleasure that 
the lead-off story was by a favo- 
rite author. 

It was a grim affair about an 
Earthman holding an outpost 
against terrific odds. He read the 
next one . about a starship that 
hit a space warp and got hurled 
into another universe. 

The third was about the Earth 
being threatened by a terrible war 
and how the hero solved the crisis 
by bringing about a condition 
which outlawed electricity, mak- 
ing it impossible in the Uni- 
verse. Without electricity, planes 
couldn’t fly and tanks couldn’t 
move and guns couldn’t be sight- 
ed in, so there was no war. 

Charley sat in the chair like 
a stricken man. The magazine 
dropped from his fingers to the 
floor and he stared across the 
room at the opposite wall with 
terror in his eyes, knowing that 
Cooper Jackson would have read 
that story too. 

After a while Charley got up 
and telephoned Doc. 

“I’m worried, Charley,” Doc 
told him. “Coop has disappear- 
ed.” 

“Disappeared!” 

“We’ve tried to keep it quiet. 
Didn’t want to stir up any fuss 
— the way Coop is and all. There 
might be too many questions.” 

“You’re looking for him?” 

“We’re looking for him,” Doc 



WORRYWART 



61 




said, “as quietly as we can. We’ve 
scoured the countryside and we’ve 
sent out wires to police officials 
and missing persons bureaus.” 
“You’ve got to find him, Doc!” 
“We’re doing all we can.” Doc 
sounded tired and a bit bewild- 
ered. 

“But where could he have 
gone?” asked Charley. “He 
doesn’t have any money, does 
he? He can’t stay hiding out too 
long without . .” 

“Coop can get money any time 
he wants it. He can get anything 
he wants any time he wants it.” 
“I see what you mean,” said 
Charley. 

“I’ll keep in touch,” said Doc. 
“Is there anything . ?” 

“Not a thing,” said Doc. “Not 
a thing that anyone can do. We 
can wait. That’s all.” 

HPHAT was months ago, and 
Charley is still waiting. 
Cooper’s still missing and 
there’s no trace of him. 

So Charley waits and worries. 
And the thing he worries about 
is Cooper’s lack of a formal edu- 
cation, his utter lack of certain 



basic common knowledge. 

There is one hope, of course — 
that Cooper, if and when he de- 
cides to act, will make his action 
retroactive, going back in time to 
outlaw not electricity itself, but 
Man’s discovery of electricity. 
For, disrupting and terrible as 
that might be, it would be bet- 
ter than the other way. 

But Charley’s afraid that 
Cooper won’t see the necessity 
for retroactive action. He’s afraid 
that Cooper won’t realize that, 
when you outlaw electricity, you 
can’t limit it to the current that 
runs through a wire to light a 
lamp or turn an engine. When 
you rule out electricity as a nat- 
ural phenomenon, you rule out 
all electricity, and that means you 
rule out an integral part of atomic 
structure. And that you affect 
not only this Earth but the en- 
tire Universe. 

So Charley sits and worries and 
waits for the flicker of the lamp 
beside his chair. 

Although he realizes, of course, 
that when it comes there won’t 
be any flicker.

THE “MARTIAN 
SPACE STATIONS” 

E VERY once in a while, say 
about five times a year, I 
receive a letter inquiring 
about the two small moons of 
Mars and whether they might not 



be space stations of the Martians. 



Some of these letters aiy tongue- 
in-cheek, others ate honest ques- 
tions, and inevitably one or two 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



simply take the artificial nature 
of the moons for granted and 
wonder whether a careful pho- 
tographic watch for “operations” 
is being kept by the Earth’s ob- 
servatories. 

My answer, of course, is always 
the same — namely that Phobos 
and Deimos are actually moons 
and not artificial structures, even 
though the Martians — if there 
were any — could make good use 
of them as space stations. 

Sometimes I get a letter back, 
asking for proof: “Are our tele- 
scopes good enough to see detail, 
so that we know they are natural 
moons?” 

Well, no. They are too far away 
(some 35 million miles when 
close) and too tiny (their diam- 
eters are estimated at 10 and 5 
miles, respectively) for telescopic 
examination of their surfaces to 
be possible. But that scarcely 
makes them artificial structures — 
and even if we knew that Mars 
was inhabited by intelligent be- 
ings, the idea would still have to 
be rejected.' 

To understand the problem, 
let’s look at the principles which 
will apply when we ourselves get 
around to putting a space station 
into an orbit around the Earth. 

rriHE first consideration will be 
to have the space station out 
far enough so that its movement 
would not be slowed by residual 

64 



air resistance. In the case of the 
Earth, 200 miles above sea level 
would do nicely, and the same 
figure could be used for Mars. 

The next consideration is the 
expense of putting the station into 
space, and the expense of main- 
taining steady supply and con- 
tact. To lift a pound 20 miles 
costs so-and-so much fuel, and 
it doesn’t matter whether you lift 
a pound of oxygen or a pound of 
stainless steel. To lift it 300 miles 
costs still more fuel. In short, 
it is more expensive to maintain 
the farther away it is (although 
the first 200 miles cost more by 
far than the next 800 miles) ; so 
the closer you can have the sta- 
tion the better, as far as fuel 
economy is concerned. 

But the problem isn’t that sim- 
ple. 

For when it comes to the in- 
herent uses of the space station, 
a longer distance is preferable. 
The station wants to see the 
ground, and, for many purposes, 
it wants to be seen. If it is farther 
away, naturally it can see more 
area at any given moment and 
can be seen from a larger area. 
However, if you place it too far 
out, you lose detail; the home 
planet should appear large, filling 
a little better than 130° of the 
sky — which means that you 
would want the space station 
closer than 54 planet diameter. 
The diameter of the Earth being 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




7900 miles, we would place our 
own space station or stations 
higher than 200 but lower than 
2000 miles. 

The precise height within these 
two limits will be decided by 
still another consideration: Since 
a very close check will be kept 
on the movements of the space 
station, it is convenient to place 
it at a distance where its natural 
period of revolution around the 
planet is an even fraction of the 
planet’s rotation. That’s the rea- 
son why von Braun wants his 
station at 1075 miles, for that 
distance produces one revolution 
in 120 minutes. It is also the rea- 
son why I advocated the distance 
of 350 miles for an unmanned 
orbital instrument carrier, because 
that distance produces a period 
of 96 minutes. 

Of course, there is the 24-hour 
orbit at 22,300 miles, where the 
period of revolution is equal to 
the Earth’s rotation; but such a 
high orbit is of little use, except 
for planet-wide radio and tele- 
vision coverage, in which case you 
need three relay stations, spaced 
120° apart, in the same orbit. 

Now that we have refreshed 
our memory, let’s check what the 
Martian “engineers” have done. 

Their space station should not 
be farther out than 1050 miles at 
the most, this being !4 planet 
diameter, and it should be no 
closer than 150 miles. One useful 



distance for Mars would be about 
500 miles from the planet’s sur- 
face — moving at a little less than 
2 miles per second, the station 
would need l/10th of a Martian 
day for one complete revolution. 

The Martian “engineers,” then, 
have done a pretty sloppy job. 

The Martian day is 24 hours, 
37 minutes and 23 seconds, or, 
forgetting about those 23 seconds, 
1477 minutes long — and the moon 
Phobos moves around the planet 
5800 miles from the center (or 
3700 miles from the surface) once 
in 7 hours and 39 minutes, or once 
in 459 minutes. This is not only 
too far out on general principles; 
it is also a time relationship which 
is about as awkward as you can 
make it. As for the moon Deimos, 
it is even beyond the distance 
which, in the case of Mars, would 
result in a one-day orbit. The 
actual distance is 12,500 miles 
from the surface, and the period 
is 30 hours and 18 minutes or 
1818 minutes. 

Sorry, gentlemen, don’t bother 
looking for “operations.” The 
moons of Mars are just moons, 
probably asteroids captured from 
the nearby belt.

very nature, small in numbers of 
membership, but spread over 
large portions of the world, ex- 
cluding the iron curtain district, 
Africa and South America. Its 
name would be “The Society of 
People Who Have Handled a 
Live Tuatara,” and I would be a 
member. 

A few months ago I reported 
on Tuatara in this column and 
on the fact that, for the first time 
in many decades, the New Zea- 
land government had permitted 
the export of a few live speci- 
mens. There is one in the New 
York Zoological Park, and one 
should assume, since I live in 
New York City, that that’s the 
one I met socially. But things 
don’t work that simply; I still 
haven’t even seen the New York 
specimen. Instead, I made the 
acquaintance of the one in the 
San Diego Zoo, and so did Ches- 
ley Bonestell. Both our thanks to 
its keeper, Mr. Shaw, who gen- 
erously pulled the somewhat re- 
luctant survivor from the Meso- 
zoic Age out of its heated cage for 
close inspection. 

An almost full-grown specimen, 
it measured 23 inches upon ar- 
rival in America, and has grown 
by about an inch since then. Be- 
cause it is mature, the pineal or 
“third” eye has virtually disap- 
peared. The third eye is reason- 
ably conspicuous in a very young 
specimen, but tends to disappear 



with increasing age, and event- 
ually it can be located only by 
a few tiny scales in a rosette -like 
arrangement. All of which proved 
to me in retrospect that the only 
other specimen I’d ever held, a 
dried one from the collection of 
the Natural History Museum in 
Berlin, was quite young. 

Handling the living specimen, 
I learned a few things about 
Tuatara that you don’t find in 
books — at least, I don’t remem- 
ber reading them. Those “spines” 
on the back of the head and on 
top of the body do not only look 
like the empty shells of sunflower 
seeds, they also feel that way — 
dry and fairly soft. And the spines 
on top of the tail are pointed and 
hard. The loose skin around the 
neck is just as loose, or even 
more so, as it looks on photo- 
graphs — it feels like fine, dry, 
old silk. As for the color, it is 
best described as “rock color” — 
neither a pronounced gray nor a 
pronounced brown — overlaid by 
a sheen of quite brilliant moss 
green. 

Tuatara has exceptionally large 
eyes, and the San Diego specimen 
is in the habit of sitting for hours 
with one eye closed. What is prob- 
ably the strangest aspect, in view 
of the background and age of the 
type, is that they like to be 
handled — after a while you 
wouldn’t be surprised if they 
purred ...

■pRIOR to that side trip to San 
Diego, Dr. Robert S. Richard- 
son had taken me up to Mt. 
Wilson Observatory. (To be pre- 
cise, it was Chesley Bonestell who 
took me up the mountain, for he 
was driving, but Dr. Richardson 
acted as guide when we reached 
the top.) The visit included a 
look at the 60-inch telescope, a 
close look at the 100-inch (which 
Arthur C. Clarke called a “Vic- 
torian instrument”) and an even 
closer look at the 150-foot solar 
tower. Dr. Richardson even took 
us up. You ride in an open steel f 
box which rises outside the tower. 
Then you step across some 18 
inches of nothing into the dome. 
And when the dome opens, you 
discover that there is no railing. 

Because I did not find the 100- 
inch especially “Victorian” my- 
self — the Flushing IRT subway is 
much more so in my opinion — 
arrangements were made to show 
me the 200-inch on Palomar 
Mountain. Of the 200-inch I can 
only say that it is colossal, 
breathtaking and awe-inspiring. 
This extends to the control 
mechanism — everything is enorm- 
ous. What is normally a reflec- 
tion inside a prism goes here 
across an entire room. Where you 
ordinarily turn a screw elsewhere, 
you have here a few handwheels. 

Even more modern looking and 
streamlined than the 200-inch is 
Palomar’s 48-inch Schmidt tele- 



scope, housed in a separate dome. 
If it were mounted in the open, 
every visitor would take it to be 
a heavy siege howitzer, complete 
with two recoil absorbers. These, 
when you look closer, turn out 
to be “finders” — small (by com- 
parison) telescopes used for aim- 
ing the camera. There are two of 
them because the Schmidt can 
work from horizon to horizon, 
and in many of its positions one 
finder is most awkwardly placed; 
then you use the other, for the 
more finder A is out of reach, 
the easier finder B can be ap- 
proached. The Schmidt bears the 
name of its originator— or in- 
ventor, if you prefer — Bernhard 
Schmidt of the observatory of 
Bergedorf, near Hamburg, Ger- 
many. 

The Schmidt is based on two 
ideas. Normally, when you build 
a telescope of the reflecting type, 
you begin by making a spherical 
mirror, which is comparatively 
easy. Then you parabolize the 
spherical mirror, which is tough 
and tedious. The difference be- 
tween the spherical surface and 
the parabolic surface is small, but 
it is an important difference — for 
one surface can be used and the 
other is useless. Useless, that is, 
until Bernhard Schmidt had the 
first of his two ideas that went 
into his invention. 

Why correct the mirror phys- 
ically, he thought. Why not 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

leave the spherical surface alone 
and correct its useless image op- 
tically? 

This required a correcting lens 
— something very hard to make, 
mostly because no such lens had 
ever been made before. In fact, 
the correcting lens is so unlike 
other lenses, and differs so little 
from a piece of plate glass, that 
many astronomers call it the cor- 
recting “plate” rather than the 
correcting “lens.” 

One thing I did not know until 
told : The designation of a 

Schmidt is based on the size of 
the correcting plate. Palomar’s 
48-inch has a correcting plate of 
that size, while the diameter of 
the spherical mirror is 72 inches. 
(Of course, there are some in- 
struments in which both units 
have the same diameter, but it is 
the correcting plate that counts.) 

Even with all this, however, 
you still don’t get your image on 
a flat plane; the image remains 
curved. And this is where Bern- 
hard Schmidt’s second idea came 
in. One could either use such a 
small portion of the focal image 
that the curvature didn’t matter 
too much; or one could sit down 
and try to figure out how to 
flatten it optically; or one could 
simply curve the photographic 
plate. 

For the 48-inch Schmidt they 
use square plates of thin glass 
(14 by 14 inches, if I remember 



correctly) which flex enough to 
fit into a plate holder that forces 
them into shape. Of course, when 
they are taken out they flatten 
again, and you have your pho- 
tograph — no optical refinements 
or fancy tricks needed. Except 
one: 

In the basement of the dome, 
there is a plate holder, with 
double the curvature of the one 
in the camera. The plate holder 
is mounted over a metal drawer, 
and there is a metal basket near- 
by. Each plate is thus tested be- 
fore use — it’s so much easier to 
dispose of a drawerful of glass 
splinters than it is to fish them 
out of a large but delicate can- 
non-shaped camera! 

MEA CULPA 

H AVE you ever, at a party, for 
example, called one person 
persistently by the name of some- 
body else, either because of an 
accidental resemblance or be- 
cause the correct name sets up 
some association of ideas? Well, 
I do this occasionally, and did 
it recently in GALAXY Science 
Fiction in a reply to a letter. 
And, of course, I was promptly 
caught — in this instance by Dr. 
Lincoln LaPaz, the Director of 
the Institute of Meteoritics of the 
University of New Mexico. 

My mistake, committed in the 
May issue, was to say that the 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Pretoria Salt Pan has a diameter 
“on the order of 20 miles.” Dr. 
LaPaz gave the correct figure in 
his letter, which is 3330-3450 feet, 
and continued: “No doubt you 
had in mind the remarkable 
Vredefort Ring structure in South 
Africa which by many is regarded 
as of meteoritic impact origin; 
and which, could we remove the 
sediments now covering much of 
the Ring, would be seen to have 
a diameter of at least 20 and, 
possibly, of as much as 30 miles.” 

Yes, this is the one I had in 
mind, and this is about the fifth 
time that I have called the Vrede- 
fort Ring the Pretoria Salt Pan. 
But it is the first time that it’s 
happened to me in print, and 
maybe this will cure me. My 
thanks to Dr. Lincoln LaPaz for 
catching it.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

I have two questions; one is: 
would a space station of Dr. von 
Braun's design be visible to the 
unaided eye from Earth? Another 
is: how much difference in “ see- 
ing” is expected by astronomers 
as they contemplate the possibil- 
ity of work outside our atmos- 
phere? 

' C. W. Olney 
356 Acacia 
Sierra Madre, Calif. 

Yes, von Braun’s space sta- 



tion would not only be visible 
from the ground, it would be a 
fairly conspicuous slow-moving 
star. It would be easiest to see 
if the observer on the ground 
had the station overhead either 
just before sunrise or soon after 
sunset. In daylight, he might 
be able to pick it out if he 
knew where to look. In fact, 
the naked eye visibility of the 
space station may have some 
propaganda value: at least one 
expert on the Far East has gone 
on record as saying that the 
existence of the “American 
star” would greatly impress the 
Asiatic peoples. 

As for the improvement of 
“seeing,” no simple answer can 
be given. Our atmosphere ab- 
sorbs radiation of different 
wavelengths to different de- 
grees. It is almost transparent 
to what we call visible light and 
to the very short electrical 
waves used in television, and 
almost opaque to other wave- 
lengths which normally never 
reach the ground. To say that 
astronomical instruments above 
the atmosphere would receive 
a total of three times as much 
radiation as they do on the 
ground Ts probably a conserva- 
tive statement. It will be at least 
that much, and it may be more. 

I would like to know whether 
it is a recognized fact that a

planet's age is the higher the 
tart her it is from the Sun. 

L. Comunale 
25-54, 38 th St. 

Long Island City 3, N. Y. 

The idea that a planet is 
older the farther it is from the 
Sun was baqpd on the so-called 
Kant-Laplace hypothesis of the 
formation of the Solar System. 
In that hypothesis, it was as- 
sumed that the matter which 
later condensed into planets had 
been thrown out from a rapidly 
spinning sun- in successive 
rings. Under this assumption it 
seemed obvious to have the age 
of a planet inversely propor- 
tional to the distance from the 
Sun, and some people even 
went ahead and calculated the 
respective ages. This was espe- 
cially reckless in view of the 
fact that they didn’t even know 
the age of the Earth. 

Current theories assume that 
all the planets were formed at 
about the same time, because 
they condensed from dust and 
gas which never was a part of 
the finished Sun. 

Is it true that if one of the 
planets were destroyed or moved 
tromJts orbit the balance of the 
whole Solar System would be de- 
stroyed? 

Philip Officer 

402 Ave. La Resolana 

Albuquerque, New Mexico. 



The mass of all the planets 
taken together is only a frac- 
tion of one per cent of the 
Sun’s mass. For this reason, the 
destruction or removal of one 
planet would not change the 
overall picture „at all. There 
would only be very minor 
changes in the orbits of the 
planets nearest the missing one. 

During the last few months I 
have read several articles and 
books about climbing Mt. Ever- 
est. Most of the climbers said 
emphatically that they did not 
use oxygen in the past and would 
not use it in the future. Yet I 
understand the Air Force makes 
everybody put on masks at 14,000 
feet, only half the height those 
people climbed to. Why do they 
disdain oxygen, not sportsman- 
like or something? 

Lucy Cores 
15 Hillside Rd. 
Larchmont, N. Y. 

In the first place, they do 
think it is not sporting to use 
oxygen in the conquest of Mt. 
Everest. As one member of a 
former expedition expressed it 
to me: “If you want to conquer 
the mountain by mechanical 
means, you might as well use 
an airplane or a helicopter.” 

But in addition to this atti- 
tude, which you may or may 
not share, there is a very sound 
practical reason. The members 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of these expeditions spend 
months at altitudes of 15,000 
to 18,000 feet, where the air 
pressure is just about half what 
it is at sea level, in order to 
accustom themselves to low 
pressures before attacking the 
29,000 foot summit. If they 
didn’t do this, hut instead re- 
lied on oxygen, and then some- 
thing went wrong with the oxy- 
gen supply . 

In such a case, an airplane 
pilot can simply put his plane 
into a steep dive and reach 
comfortable levels in a matter 
of minutes. But the mountain 
climbers could not get to com- 
fortable levels and would perish. 

Post Script, June 2, 1953: 
Everest climbed . with oxy- 
gen. 

What is a “space warp” and 
how does it work? 

Larry Givens 
RFD No. 1 
Wexford, Penna. 

A “space warp” may simply 
be defined as a term in the 
science fiction fan’s vocabulary. 
In stories it is used when the 
author has to get a spaceship 
over a distance of a few hun- 
dred light years in a hurry, and 
as usually stated to be a fourth- 
dimensional phenomenon. 

One explanation read as fol- 
lows: supposing you have a 
book, whose pages are inhabit- 



ed by two-dimensional crea- 
tures. One of them is sitting in 
the center of a left-hand page 
and wants to go to the center 
of the right-hand page. For the 
two-dimensional creature, this 
would be a fairly long voyage; 
but a three-dimensional crea- 
ture would simply step across 
the tiny gap separating the two 
pages of the (closed) book. 

In this explanation, the space 
warp is a kind of shortcut 
through the fourth dimension. 
Other authors do not bother to 
explain it at all. Still others 
call it “hyperspace.” 

How cold is it in space? 

Russell Chauvenet 
721 Gist Avenue 
Silver Spring, Md. 

This is a question which re- 
quires two answers, the first be- 
ing that space is neither hot nor 
cold; it simply does not have 
any temperature at all. Only 
material things ean have a 
temperature. Space is not mate- 
rial, hence it cannot have a 
temperature. 

But it is a different story if 
you ask about matter in space. 
A piece of matter will, of 
course, acquire a temperature: 
on one side, it will be illumi- 
nated and warmed by the Sun; 
on the other side, it will radiate 
some heat away. After a while, 
a balance of some sort will be 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

reached, known technically as 
“thermal equilibrium.” 

The most important factor 
is, obviously, the distance from 
the Sun. A secondary factor is 
the nature of the body, espe- 
cially its color — a dark body 
will absorb more heat than a 
light body. If you assume a 
color — black, for example — 
you can calculate what tem- 
peratures a body would ac- 
quire : 

At the distance of Mercury, 
(from the Sun) a black body 
would be 180° C (356° F) ; at 
the distance of Venus, 65° C 
(149° F) ; at the distance of 
Earth, 15° C (59° F), and at 
the distance of Mars — 30° C 
( — 22° F). 

Beyond the orbit of Mars, the 
color of a body hardly matters 
any more; at the distance of 
Jupiter the temperature would 
be — 145° C; at the distance of 
Saturn — 180° C; at that of 
Uranus — 210° C, and at that 
of Neptune — 220° C. One light 
year from the Sun the body 
would be within about one de- 
gree of absolute zero: — 272° 
C. 

Is there a simple formula for 
the distance I can see if I am fly- 
ing in an airplane? 

Henry C. Backer 

2232 Rhode Island Ave. NE 

Washington, D. C. 



Yes, there is, but you have to 
know how high you are, ex- 
pressed in feet. 

Take the square root of the 
height and multiply it by 1.317 ; 
the result will be the distance 
of the horizon in miles. The 
Smithsonian Institution says 
that this formula includes both 
the curvature of the Earth and 
refraction. Since 1.317 is fairly 
close to 1 1/3, you can simply 
take the square root of your 
height and add one third to it. 
The same formula for the 
metric system reads: Square 
root of height expressed in 
meters, multiplied by 3.839, 
gives horizon distance in kilo- 
meters. 

I know that A.U, stands for 
“astronomical unit ” and refers to 
the distance from the Sun to the 
Earth. But I also know that this 
distance is not always the same. 
Which figure is meant when as- 
tronomers say A.U .? 

Gloria Kupp 
6033 Burdey Avenue 
Chicago, 111. 

The latest figure I have been 
able to find for the numerical 
value of an astronomical unit 
is that announced by Sir Harold 
Spencer Jones : 93,003,000 

miles. But since A.U.s are 
normally used only for express- 
ing general relationships, 93 
million miles is good enough.

PROBLEM 
ON BALAK 

By ROGER DEE 

Sometimes you can solve your 
problem by running out on it! 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 

W HAT I’m getting at is little apple like that, any more 
that you don’t ever have than you’d expect a four man 
to worry about being complement like ours to be hand- 
bored stiff in Solar Exploitations ed the sort of life-and-death

PROBLEM ON BALAK 



73 




Balakian native. Or, to be more 
accurate, before he met us. 

Corelli and I were filling our 
little sterilized bottles with sam- 
ples of soil and vegetation and 
keeping a wary eye out for pos- 
sible predators when it happened. 
Gibbons, our ecologist and the 
scientific mainspring of our crew, 
was watching a swarm of little 
twelve-legged bugs that were 
busily pollinating a dwarf shrub 
at the top and collecting payment 
in drops of white sap that oozed 
out at the bottom in return. His 
eyes were shining behind their 
spectacles, and he was swearing 
to himself in a pleased monotone. 

“Signal the ship and tell the 
Quack — if you can pry that hy- 
pochondriac idiot away from his 
gargles and germicide sprays — 
to bring out a live-specimen con- 
tainer,” he called to Captain 
Corelli. “We’ve stumbled onto 
something really new here, a con- 
scious symbiosis between entirely 
dissimilar life-forms! If the rest 
of the flora and fauna cooperate 
like this . .” 

At the moment, Gibbons’ dis- 
covery didn’t register, because it 
was just then that the first Balak- 
ian showed himself. 

The native looked at first 
glance something like a wrinkled 
pink octopus, standing three feet 
high and nearly as broad, and 
he walked in a skip-a-step swing 
like a man on crutches because 




his three short legs were set in 
a horizontal row. He had four 
arms to each side, the lower ones 
meant for grasping and holding 
and the upper ones for manipu- 
lation. He didn’t have a head, ex- 
actly, but there was a face of 
sorts up near the top of the body 
that looked like nothing so much 
as a politely grinning Oriental’s. 

He wasn’t armed, but I took no | 
chances — I dropped my specimen J 
kit and yanked out the heat-gun * 
that is a part of every S.E. field i 
operative’s gear. Captain Corelli, 
who was on the point of calling 
the Quack at the ship, took his

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




thumb off the mike button and 
grabbed for his own weapon. Gib- 
bons, like a true scientist, stood 
by with his mouth open, too inter- 
ested to be scared. 

Then the Balakian spoke, and 
Corelli and I gaped wider than 
Gibbons. As I said before, Balak 
is some 20,000 light-years from 
Earth, and to our knowledge we 
were the first human beings ever 
to come within a hundred parsecs 
of the place. 

“Please don’t shoot, gentle- 
men,” he said to us in Terran. 
“My name is Gaff a, and I assure 
you that I am quite friendly.” 

PROBLEM ON BALAK 



T HAD to give Gibbons credit 
for being fast on his mental 
feet; he had taken over before 
Corelli and I could get our 
mouths closed, and was talking to 
the native as if this sort of thing 
happened every time we made 
planetfall. 

“You speak Terran fluently,” 
Gibbons said. “Or is this some 
sort of telepathic contact that 
creates the illusion of oral com- 
munication?” 

The native grinned delightedly. 
“The contact is oral. We learned 
your language from an independ- 
ent planet-hunter named Haslop, 

75 



who was wrecked here some years 
ago.” 

In Solar Exploitations you learn 
to expect the unexpected, but to 
me this was stretching coinci- 
dence clear out of joint. We had 
the latest zero-interval-transfer- 
ence drive made, and I couldn’t 
believe that any independent 
planet-staker could have beaten 
us here with outmoded equip- 
ment. 

“A Terran?” I asked. “Where 
is he now?” 

“Coming up,” Gaffa said. “With 
my fellows.” 

A couple of dozen other Balak- 
ians, looking exactly like him, 
bore down on us through the 
dwarf shrubbery, and with them 
were two lanky Terrans dressed 
in loose shirt-and-drawers en- 
sembles which obviously had been 
made on Balak. Even at a dis- 
tance the Terrans looked disturb- 
ingly alike, and when they got 
closer I could see that they were 
identical twins. 

“You don’t count so good, 
chum,” I said. “I see two Ter- 
rans.” 

“Only one,” Gaffa corrected, 
grinning wider. “The other is one 
of us.” 

I didn’t believe it, of course. 
Corelli didn’t get it, either; his 
eyes had a glazed look, and he 
was shaking his head like a man 
with a gnat in his ear. 

One of the Terrans rushed up 



to us with tears in his eyes and 
his Adam’s apple bobbing, so 
overcome with emotion that I 
was afraid he might kiss us. 

“I’m Ira Haslop,” he said in a 
choked voice. “I’ve been ma- 
rooned here for twenty-two 
eternal years, and I never thought 
I’d see a Terran face again. And 
now — ” 

He stopped, but not for breath. 
The other skinny Terran had 
grabbed his arm and swung him 
around. 

“What the hell do you think 
you’re doing, you masquerading 
nightmare?” the second one 
yelled. “I’m Ira Haslop, and you 
damn well know it! If you think 
you’re going to pass yourself off 
as me and go home to Earth in 
my place ...” 

The first Haslop gaped at him 
for a moment; then he slapped 
the other’s hand off his arm and 
shook a bony fist in his face. 

“So that’s your game! That’s 
why these grinning freaks made 
you look like me and threw us 
together all these years — they’ve 
planned all along to ring in a 
switch and send you home instead 
of me! Well, it won’t work!” 

rriHE second Haslop swung on 
him then and the two of them 
went to the mat like a pair of 
loose-drawered tigers, cursing and 
gouging. The grinning natives 
separated them after a moment 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and examined them carefully for 
damage, chattering away with 
great satisfaction in their own 
language. 

Corelli and Gibbons and I 
stared at each other like three 
fools. It was impossible to think 
that either of the two men could 
be anything but what he claimed 
to be, a perfectly normal and 
thoroughly angry Terran; but 
when each of them swore that 
one of them — the other one, of 
course — was an alien, and the na- 
tives backed up the accusation, 
what else could we believe? 

Gaffa, who seemed to be a sort 
of headman, took over and ex- 
plained the situation — which 
seemed to be an incredibly long- 
range gag cooked up by these 
octopod jokers, without the orig- 
inal Haslop’s knowledge, against 
the day when another Terran ship 
might land on Balak. Their real 
intent, Gaffa said, was to present 
us with a problem that could be 
solved only by a species with a 
real understanding of its own 
kind. If we could solve it, his 
people stood ready to assist us in 
any way possible. If not . 

I didn’t like the sound of it, so 
I reached for my heat-gun again. 
So did Captain Corelli and Gib- 
bons, but we were too slow. 

A little stinging bug — another 
link in the cooperative Balakian 
ecology — bit each of us on the 
back of the neck and we passed 



out cold. When we woke up again, 
we were “guests” of Gaffa and his 
tribe in a sort of settlement miles 
from the S.E.2100, and there 
wasn’t so much as a nail file 
among us in the way of weapons. 

The natives hadn’t bothered to 
shackle us or lock us up. We 
found ourselves lying instead in 
the middle of a circular court 
surrounded by mossy mounds 
that looked like flattened bee- 
olives, but which were actually 
dwellings where the Balakians 
lived. 

We learned later that the build- 
ings were constructed by swarms 
of tiny burrowing brutes like 
termites, who built them up grain 
by grain according to specifica- 
tions. I can’t begin to explain the 
principle behind the harmony ex- 
isting between all living things on 
Balak; it just was, and seemed to 
operate like a sort of hyper- 
sympathy or interlocking tele- 
pathy between species. Every 
creature on the planet performed 
some service for some other crea- 
ture — even the plants, which grew 
edibles without pain-nerves so it 
wouldn’t hurt to be plucked, and 
which sent up clouds of dust-dry 
spores once a week to make it 
rain. 

And the three-legged, eight-

ested at first in it as an geological 
marvel, of course. From the mo- 
ment we woke up we were too 
busy with plans for escaping the 
trap we’d fallen into. 

ffnpHE Quack is our only 
*■- hope,” Captain Corelli said, 
and groaned at the thought. “If 
that hypochondriac idiot has 
brains enough to sit tight, we may 
have a chance. If they get him, 
too, we’re lost.” 

The Quack was a damned poor 
reed to lean on. 

His name was Alvin Frick, but 
no one ever used it. He was 
twenty-nine, and would never 
have rated a space berth as any- 
thing but a hydroponics attend- 
ant, which is one step above 
manual labor. He was short, 
plump and scrubbed to the pink, 
and he was the only hypochondri- 
ac I ever knew in this modem age 
of almost no sickness. He grous- 
ed about the germs swarming in 
his reduction tanks, and he was 
scared green, in spite of his per- 
manent immunization shots, that 
he’d contract some nameless alien 
disease at every planetfall. He 
dosed himself continuously with 
concoctions whipped up from an 
old medical book he had found 
somewhere, and he spent most of 
his off-duty time spraying himself 
and his quarters with disinfectant. 
His mania had only one good 
facet — if he had been the care- 



less sort, hydroponics being what 
it is, he’d have smelled like a 
barnyard instead of a dispensary. 

We had never made any at- 
tempt to get rid of him, since we 
might have drawn an even worse 
tank-farmer, but we began to wish 
now that we had. We had hardly 
begun to figure ways and means 
of escaping when a bunch of grin- 
ning natives swung into our court 
and deposited the Quack, sleep- 
ing soundly, in our midst. 

He came to just before sun- 
down, and when we told him 
what had happened, he promptly 
passed out again — this time from 
fright. 

“A fine lot of help you are, you 
super-sterile slob,” I said when he 
woke up for the second time. I’d 
probably have said worse, but it 
was just then that the real squeeze 
began. 

Gaffa came back with the two 
scowling Haslops in tow and 
handed us the problem his tribe 
had spent twenty-two years in 
working up. 

“We have learned enough al- 
ready from Haslop,” Gaffa said, 
“to know something of the pres- 
sures and complexities that fol- 
low the expansion of your Terran 
Realm through the galaxy, and to 
assure us that in time we must 
either become a part of that 
Realm or isolate ourselves com- 
pletely. 

“We are a peaceful species and

feel that we should probably 
benefit as much from your phys- 
ical sciences as your people would 
from our biological skills, but 
there is a question of compati- 
bility that must be settled first, 
before we may risk making our- 
selves known to Terra. So we 
have devised a test to' determine 
what our course shall be.” 

W E raised our brows at one 
another over that, not guess- 
ing at the time just what the 
Balakians really had on the ball. 

“For thousands of generations, 
we have devoted our energies to 
knowing ourselves and our en- 
vironment,” Gaff a said, “because 
we know that no species can be 
truly balanced unless it under- 
stands itself. The symbiosis be- 
tween all life-forms on our planet 
is the result of that knowledge. 
We should like to assure our- 
selves that you are capable of 
understanding your own kind as 
well before we offer our services 
to your Terran Realm — and 
therein lies the test we have ar- 
ranged for you.” 

Captain Corelli drew himself 
up stiffly. “I think,” he said, “that 
the three of us should be able to 
unravel your little riddle, if you’ll 
condescend to tell us what it is.” 
Gaff a sent a puzzled look at 
the Quack, and I could see that 
he was wondering why Corelli 
hadn’t included him in the boast. 

PROBLEM ON BALAK 



But Gaff a didn’t know how sim- 
ple the Quack could be, nor how 
preoccupied with his own physi- 
ology he was. 

“One of these two,” said Gaffa, ' 

* 

pointing to the two Haslops, “is 
the original Ira Haslop, who was 
stranded here twenty-two Terran 
years ago. The other is a syn- 
thetic creation of ours — an an- 
droid, if you like, who is identical, 
cell by cell, with the original so 
far as exterior likeness is con- 
cerned. We could not duplicate 
the interior- without dissection, 
which of course was out of the 
question, so we were forced to 
make compromises that — ” 

Gibbons interrupted him in- 
credulously. “You mean you’ve 
created a living creature, brain 
and all?” 

“Only the body,” Gaffa said. 
“Creation of intelligence is still 
beyond us. The brain of the 
duplicate Haslop is one of our 
own, transplanted and condi- 
tioned to Haslop’s knowledge, 
memories and ideology.” 

He paused for a moment, and 
the waiting circle of Balakians 
grinned with him in anticipation. 

“Your problem is this,” Gaffa 
said. “If you know yourselves 
well enough to merit our help, 
then you should be able to dis- 
tinguish readily between the real 
and false Haslops. If you fail, we 
shall have no alternative but to 
keep you here on Balak for the 

79 




rest of your lives, since to release 
you would bring other Terrans 
down on us in force.” 

And that was it. All we had to 
do was to take these two identical 
twins — who looked alike, thought 
alike and cursed alike — and de- 
termine which was real and which 
was bogus. 

“For a very pertinent reason 
which you may or may not dis- 
cover,” Gaff a said, “the test must 
be limited to a few hours. You 
have until sunrise tomorrow 
morning, gentlemen.” 

And with that he crutched away 
at his skip-a-step walk, taking 
his grinning cohorts with him. 
The two Haslops remained be- 
hind, glowering and grumbling at 
each other. 

T HE situation didn’t look too 
bad at first. 

“There are no two things,” 
Captain Corelli declared, “that 
are exactly and absolutely iden- 
tical. And that applies, I should 
say, especially to identities.” 

It had a heartening sound. I’ve 
never been long on logic, being a 
very ordinary S.E. navigator 
whose automatic equipment is 
designed to do practically every- 
thing for him, and Corelli seemed 
to know what he was talking 
about. 

Gibbons, being a scientist, saw 
it differently. 

“That’s not even good sophis- 



try,” he said. “The concept of 
identity between two objects has 
no meaning whatever, Captain, 
unless we have a prior identifica- 
tion of one or the other. Aristotle 
himself couldn’t have told an 
apple from a coconut if he’d 
never seen or heard of either.” 
“Any fool would know that,” 
one of the Haslops grunted. And 
the other added in the same tone : 
“Hey, if you guys are going at it 
like that, we’ll be here forever!” 
“All right,” Corelli said, de- 
flated. “We’ll try another tack.” 
He thought for a minute or 
two. “How about screening them 
for background detail? The real 
Haslop was a bounty-claimer, 
which means that he must have 
made thousands of planetfalls be- 
fore crashing here. The bogus one 
couldn’t remember the details of 
all those worlds as well as the 
original, no matter how many 
times he’d been told, could he?” 
“Won’t work,” one of the Has- 
lops said disgustedly. “Hell, after 
twenty-two years I can’t remem- 
ber those places myself, and I 
was there.” 

The other Haslop gave him a 
dirty look. “You were here, fel- 
low — I was there.” 

And to the captain he said, 
“We’re getting nowhere, friend. 
You’re underestimating these 
Balakians — they look and act like 
screwballs, but they’re sharp. In 
the twenty-two years I’ve lived 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with that carbon copy of myself, 
he’s learned everything I know.” 

‘‘He’s right,” Gibbons put in. 
He blinked a couple of times and 
turned pink. “Unless the real 
Haslop happened to be married, 
that is. I’m a bachelor myself, but 
I’d say there are some memories 
that a married man wouldn’t dis- 
cuss, even when marooned.” 

Captain Corelli stared at him 
admiringly. “I never gave you 
enough credit, Gibbons,” he said. 
“You’re right! How about — ” 

“Don’t help any,” one of the 
Haslops said morosely. “I never 
was married. And now I never 
will be if I’ve got to depend on 
you jerks to get me out of this 
mess.” 

The sun went down just then 
and a soft, drowsy darkness fell. 
I thought at first that we’d have 
to finish our investigation in the 
dark, but the natives had made 
provisions for that. A swarm of 
fireflies as big as robins sailed in 
from somewhere and circled 
around over the court, lighting it 
as bright as day. The Balakian 
houses made a dim row of flat- 
tened shadow-mounds at the out- 
skirts of the circle. A ring of 
natives sat tailor -fashion on the 
ground in front of them — a neat 
trick considering that they had 
three legs each to fold up — and 
grinned at us. 

They had waited twenty-two 
years for this show, and now that 



it had come they were enjoying 
every minute of it. 

O UR investigation was pretty 
rough going. The fireflies 
overhead all circled in one direc- 
tion, which made you dizzy every 
time you looked up, and besides 
that the Quack had remembered 
that he was a prisoner in an 
alien environment and was at the 
mercy of any outlandish disease 
that might creep past his perma- 
nent immunization. He muttered 
and grumbled to himself about 
the risk, and his grousing got on 
our nerves even worse than usual. 

I moved over to shut him up, 
and blinked when I saw him pop 
something into his mouth. My 
first guess was that he had man- 
aged to sneak some food concen- 
trate out of the ship somehow, 
and the thought made me realize 
how hungry I was. 

“What’ve you got there, 
Quack?” I demanded. “Come on, 
give — what are you hiding out?” 
“Antibiotics and stuff,” he an- 
swered, and pulled a little flat 
plastic case out of a pocket. 

It was his portable medicine 
chest, which he carried the way 
superstitious people used to carry 
rabbits’ feet, and it was largely 
responsible for our calling him 
the Quack. It was full of patent 
capsule remedies that he had 
gleaned out of his home medical 
book — a cut thumb, a surprise 



PROBLEM ON BALAX

headache, or a siege of gas on the 
stomach would never catch the 
Quack unprepared! 

“Jerk,” I said, and went back 
to Gibbons and Corelli, who were 
arguing a new approach to our 
problem. 

“It’s worth a try,” Gibbons 
said. He turned on the two Has- 
lops, who were bristling like a pair 
of strange dogs. “This question is 
for the real Haslop: Have you 
ever been put through a Ror- 
schach, thematic apperception or 
free association test?” 

The real Haslop hadn’t. Either 
of them. 

“Then we’ll try free associa- 
tion,” Gibbons said, and explained 
what he wanted of them. 

“Water," Gibbons said, pop- 
ping it out quick and sharp. 

“Spigot,” the Haslops said to- 
gether. Which is exactly what any 
spaceman would say, since the 
only water important to him 
comes out of a ship’s tank. “Lake” 
and “river” and “spring,” to him, 
are only words in books. 

Gibbons chewed his lip and 
tried again, but the result was 
the same every time. When he 
said “payday” they both came 
back “binge,” and when he said 
“man” they answered “woman!” 
with the same gleam in their eyes. 

“I could have told you it 
wouldn’t work,” one Haslop said 
when Gibbons threw up his hands 
and quit. “I’ve lived so long with 



that phony that he even knows 
what I’m going to say next.” 

“I was -going to say the same 
thing,” the other one growled. 
“After twenty-two years of drink- 
ing and arguing with him, we’ve 
begun — God help me! — to think 
alike.” 

I tried my own hand just once. 

“Gaff a says that they are ex- 
actly identical so far as outside 
appearance goes,” I said. “But 
he may be wrong, or lying. May- 
be we’d better check for our^ 
selves.” 

HPHE Haslops raised a howl, of 
course, but it did them no 
good. Gibbons and Corelli and I 
ganged them one at a time — the 
Quack refused to help for fear of 
being contaminated — and ex- 
amined them carefully. It was a 
lively job, since both of them 
swore they were ticklish, and un- 
der different circumstances it 
could have been embarrassing. 

But it settled one point. Gaff a 
hadn’t lied. They were absolutely 
identical, as far as we could de- 
termine. 

We had given it up and were 
resting from our labors when 
Gaff a came grinning out of the 
darkness and brought us a big 
crystal pitcher of something that 
would have passed for a first- 
class Planet Punch except that 
it was nearer two-thirds alcohol 
than the fifty-fifty mix you get at 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




most interplanetary ginmills. 

The two Haslops had a slug of 
it as a matter of course, being 
accustomed to it, and the rest of 
us followed suit. Only the Quack 
refused, turning green at the 
thought of all the alien bacteria 
that might be swimming around 
in the pitcher. 

A couple of drinks made us 
feel better. 

"I’ve been thinking," Captain 
Corelli said, “about what GafTa 
said when he limited the time of 
the test, that we might or might 
not discover the reason for our- 
selves. Now what the hell did the 
grinning heathen mean by that? 
Is there a reason, or was he only 
dragging a red herring across the 
bogus Haslop’s track?” 

Gibbons looked thoughtful. I 
sat back while he pondered and 
watched the Quack, who was 
swallowing another antibiotic cap- 
sule. 

"Wait a minute,” Gibbons ex- 
claimed. “Captain, you’ve hit on 
something there!” 

He stared at the Haslops. They 
stared back, unimpressed. 

“Gaffa said you two were ex- 
actly alike outside,” Gibbons said. 
“And we’ve proved it. Does that 
mean you’re not alike inside?” 

“Sure,” one of them said. “But 
what of it? You’re sure as hell 
not going to cut one of us open 
to see!” 

“You’re confusing the issue,” 

PROBLEM ON BAIAK 



Gibbons snapped. “What I’m get- 
ting at is this — if you two aren’t 
made alike inside, then you can’t 
possibly exist on the same sort 
of diet. One of you eats the same 
sort of food as ourselves. The 
other can’t. But which is which?” 
One of the Haslops pointed a 
quivering finger at the other. “It’s 
him!” he said. “I’ve watched him 
drink his dinner for twenty-two 
years — he’s the fake!” 

“Liar!” the other one yelled, 
springing up. Corelli stepped be- 
tween them and the second Has- 
lop subsided, grumbling. “It’s true 
enough, only he's the one that 
drinks his meals. This stuff in the 
pitcher is the food he lives on — 
alcohol for energy, with minerals 
and other stuff dissolved in it. I 
drink it with him for kicks, but 
that phony can’t eat anything 
else.” 

C ORELLI snapped his fingers. 

“So that’s why they limited 
our time, and why they brought 
this stuff — to keep their fake Has- 
lop refueled! All we’ve got to do to 
separate our men now is feed them 
something solid. The one that eats 
it is the real Haslop.” 

“Sure, all we need now is some 
solid food,” I said. “You don’t 
happen to have a couple of sand- 
wiches on you, do you?” 

Everybody got quiet for a cou- 
ple of minutes, and in the silence 
the Quack surprised us all by 



83 




deciding to speak up. 

“Since I’m stuck here for life,” 
he said, “a few germs more or 
less won’t matter much. Pass me 
the pitcher, will you?” 

He took a man-sized slug of 
the fiery stuff without even wip- 
ing off the pitcher’s rim. 

After that we gave it up, as 
who wouldn’t have? Captain Co- 
relli said the hell with it and 
took such a slug out of the 
pitcher that the two Haslops 
yelled murder and grabbed it 
quick themselves, and from then 
on we just sat around and drank 
and talked and waited for the 
sunrise that would condemn us to 
Balak for the rest of our lives. 

Thinking about our problem 
had reminded me of an old puz- 
zle I’d heard somewhere about 
three men being placed in a room 
where they can see each other 
but not themselves; they’re shown 
three white hats and two black 
ones, and then they’re blindfold- 
ed and a hat is put on each of 
their heads. When the blindfolds 
are, taken off, the third man knows 
by looking at the other two and 
by what they say just what color 
hat he’s wearing himself, but I 
always forget how it is that he 
knows. 

We got so interested in the 
hat problem that the east was 
turning pink before we realized it. 

None of us actually saw the 
sun rise, though, except the 



Quack and the bogus Haslop. 

I was right in the middle of a 
sentence when all of a sudden my 
stomach rolled over and growled 
like a dying tiger, and I never 
had such an all-gone feeling in 
my life. I looked at the others, 
wondering if the stuff in the 
pitcher had poisoned us all, and 
saw Gibbons and Corelli staring 
at each other with the same 
startled look in their eyes. One 
of the Haslops was hit, too — he 
had the same pinched expression 
around the mouth, and perspira- 
tion stood out on his forehead in 
drops as big as grapes. 

And then the four of us were 
on our feet and dashing for open 
country, leaving the Quack and 
the remaining Haslop staring after 
us. The Haslop who stayed 
looked puzzled, I thought, but 
the Quack only seemed inter- 
ested and very much entertained. 

I couldn’t be sure of that, 
though. There wasn’t time to 
look twice. 

W HEN we came back to the 
court later, shaken and pale 
and bracing ourselves for another 
dash at any minute, we found 
Gaff a and his grinning chums 
congratulating the Quack. The 
bogus Haslop had dropped his 
impersonation act and seemed 
very happy. 

“I’ve learned to like Haslop so 
well after twenty-two years,” he 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




said, “that I’m quite prejudiced 
in favor of his species, and I’m 
delighted that we are to join your 
Realm. Balak and Terra will get 
along famously, I know, since you 
people are so ingenious and ap- 
preciative of humor.” 

We ignored the Balakians and 
swooped down on the Quack. 

“You put something in that 
pitcher after you drank out of 
it, you insult to humanity,” I 
said. “What was it?” 

The Quack backed off with a 
wary look in his eye. 

“A recipe from the curiosa sec- 
tion of my medical book,” he 
said. “I whipped up some cap- 
sules for my pocket kit, just in 
case of emergency, and I couldn’t 
help thinking of them when — ” 
“Never mind the buildup,” 
Captain Corelli said. “What was 
it?” 

“A formula invented by ancient 
Terran bartenders, and not 
recommended except in extreme 
cases,” the Quack said. “With a 



very odd name. It’s called a twin 
Mickey.” 

We’d probably have murdered 
him then and there if the Quack’s 
concoction had let us. 

Later on we had to admit that 
the Quack had actually done us 
a service, since his identifying the 
real Haslop saved us from being 
marooned for life on Balak. And 
the Balakians were such an im- 
mediate sensation in the Terran 
Realm that the Quack’s part in 
their admittance made him fa- 
mous overnight. Somebody high 
up in Goverment circles got him 
out of Solar Exploitations field 
work and gave him a sinecure in 
an antibiotics laboratory, where 
he wound up as happy as a pig 
in a peanut field. 

Which points up the statement 
I made in the beginning, that one 
thing you never have to worry 
about in Solar Exploitations work 
is being bored. 

You see what I mean?

F OR about the last five hun- 
dred hours of deceleration, 
the rings were plainly visi- 
ble to the unaided eye. Looking 
out through the ports and seeing 
Saturn, suspended in three-quar- 
ter phase against the blackness, 
we realized fully for the first time 
that we were approaching the 
outermost dwelling-place of Man 
— his closest colonized approach 
to the edge of interstellar empti- 
ness. 

Grenville was in high spirits at 
the long and cramped voyage 
being nearly over, and even be- 
fore Titan showed a perceptible 
disc, he was floating about the 
cabin singing happily to himself. 
Dagmar was still as sulky and 
disagreeable as she had been for 
most of the voyage. The bursts 
of boisterous good humor which 
from the start had intermittently 
broken this mood, however, be- 
gan to increase in frequency. 

Of course she was looking for- 
ward to getting out of that 
cramped little spaceboat even 
more than Grenville and myself. 
She had said a lot of bitter words 
on the way about the discomfort 
of living in the small cabin for so 
long, with only a blanket stretch- 
ed across it to give her a bit of 



FAR FROM THE WARMING

privacy. Also, sanitary arrange- 
ments in such small craft are 
necessarily rather primitive, 
which annoyed her even more. 

Women can be so damned 
practical— even when fleeing for 
their lives! 

TJ7E were within Titan's orbit 
about its primary when 
Grenville told me we were going 
to have trouble getting down. 

“It’ll mean a braking orbit 
through the atmosphere, Mr. 
Clemmenceton. We had to take 
a chance on cutting it this fine, 
and it looks as though we’re on 
the losing end. We’re in for a 
hard bump.” 

“Well, do your best,” I said. 

“I t K ’nk we should be able to 
touch down without killing our- 
selves, but we’ll have to get into 
spacesuits and be well strapped 
in for it.” 

“You won’t be able to control 
the ship strapped into a bump- 
seat,” I objected. 

He grinned at me and said: “I 
can strap my head and body firm, 
and leave the arms and legs out. 
That will do.” 

So that was how we did it. 
Dagmar, of course, complained 
irritably about the whole per- 
formance, but was too concerned 
about keeping that beautiful, del- 
icate body of hers from getting 
hurt to neglect any of the pre- 
cautions. 



It would be a pity to have got 
this far only to crash on Titan 
itself, I reflected. But Grenville 
would get us down safely if any- 
one could. He was a magnificent 
space pilot. Certainly few others 
could have evaded those two 
cruisers which challenged us just 
beyond the orbit of Mars. The 
following two weeks of sporadic 
acceleration and sidewinding ate 
up our fuel load, but they got us 
safely into the Asteroid Belt, 
where the cruisers’ detection gear 
was useless. Now, though, with- 
out enough fuel for a landing, we 
faced the reckoning. 

We struck the outer fringes of 
Titan’s methane atmosphere still 
doing over five miles a second. 
The poor little yacht heated up 
like a reactor. Fortunately, the 
outside temperature was some- 
thing like minus one hundred 
Centigrade, and the heat was dis- 
persed fast enough to keep the 
outer skin no hotter than a dull 
red. 

The refrigeration pumps were 
overloaded keeping the inside 
temperature down, but we were 
in suits by this time and not too 
worried. 

Grenville carefully kept fuel 
consumption down to a mini- 
mum, letting the atmospheric 
drag do all the work. It was a 
masterly display of craftsman- 
ship, but, even so, it was not 
enough to avoid a crash.

Grenville had strapped Dag- 
mar and myself so tightly into 
the shock-seats that neither of us 
could move a limb. Then he had 
fixed chest, thigh and waist bands 
about himself and adjusted the 
headrest to hold his head firm. 

The tank dials showed “empty” 
at about nine hundred feet from 
the surface, but we got down to 
a hundred before the braking 
blasts cut out. Then we dropped 
free and hit hard with a grinding 
crunch. 

I was momentarily dazed by 
the jar, but unhurt. Dagmar was 
apparently unconscious, though 
not visibly injured. I looked for- 
ward to see Grenville, his safety 
straps torn from their fastenings, 
thrown limply over the control 
panel. I Waited a moment to re- 
cover a little, then pushed the 
release button under the seat- 
arm, slipped free, and maneuver- 
ed over to him. 

As I reached him, I heard a 
soft moan from Dagmar, and 
turned to see her open her eyes. 
She said a few choice words about 
Grenville and myself, and started 
to feel for her own release button. 
I gathered from this that there 
was nothing seriously the matter 
with her and turned my attention 
back to Grenville. 

TTIS face was very white. His 
suit radio had been left on, 
and I tried to rouse him by call- 



ing his name. No result. Dagmar 
was ignoring us both. She shud- 
dered violently, then dropped her 
space-helmeted head into her 
gauntleted hands and began to 
cry. Grenville’s lips moved slight- 
ly. I called his name again, and 
this time he blinked his eyes open. 
Immediately, pain made him 
catch his breath sharply. 

“Oh, God, my leg!” he groaned. 

He had been stretched across 
the lower bank of firing levers, 
with his left leg twisted and 
forced between one of the stan- 
chions and the instrument panel 
supports. His spacesuit had not 
been punctured, but from the 
way his leg was twisted, it looked 
as though there would be a break 
somewhere above the knee. 

“It’s bleeding,” he said between 
clenched teeth. “The whole leg 
is warm and sticky.” 

“Dagmar, see if the airlock 
works,” I called. 

It didn’t register. She was still 
crying. 

I left Grenville and climbed aft 
over the mass of jufik littered 
over the buckled floor-plates. The 
airlock, I found, had been dented, 
but not totally wrecked, and 
might still be airtight. 

I -returned for Grenville, car- 
ried him into the lock in a fire- 
man’s lift — strenuous work for a 
man well into his fifties, even in 
Titan’s point three gravity — and 
opened the small test-valve in the

gasket of my helmet to sniff the 
air. It was cold and smelled 
slightly of methane. There was 
a leak somewhere, probably 
around some part of the outer 
door, but only a slow one. 

“We’ll have time to look at 
that leg before the air gets bad,” 
I told Grenville. “I’ll help you 
peel off that suit.” 

Sitting on the metal floor with 
his legs stretched out in front of 
him, he rolled first to one side 
and then the other so I could get 
his spacesuit off. Then it took 
only a few seconds to rip his uni- 
form trouser leg and expose the 
thigh. 

I got a nasty shock when I 
saw the break, a bad compound 
fracture. He had already lost a 
lot of blood, and there was no 
time to be wasted in getting a 
tourniquet into place. He had to 
do it himself, tying the torn 
cloth above the wound, because 
the gauntlets of the suit I was 
still wearing made my hands far 
too clumsy for the task. He tied 
the last knot and the spurt of ar- 
terial blood eased to a red trickle. 

A spasm of coughing shook 
him, and he started to rub his 
eyes. 

“Just finished in time,” he 
gasped, blinking tearily. “Meth- 
ane’s bad enough, but now I’m 
beginning to get lungfuls of am- 
monia. It hurts the leg like 
blazes, too. Give me a hand.” 



He lifted his helmet into place 
and I got him back into his suit. 

VIOLENT pounding on the 
inner door told" us Dagmar 
was over one emotional reaction 
and ready for another. The inter- 
com was out of action and the 
helmet radios useless with the 
steel bulkhead between us, but 
as I had spun the handle and be- 
gun to open the door, her angry 
voice sounded from my ear- 
phones. 

“ — by myself out there! By 
God, Wolseley, I’ll get even with 
you for dragging me along on 
this idiotic — ” 

“Easy, woman; we’re in no 
danger now, and I had to help 
tie up Grenville’s leg,” I answer- 
ed, as gently as I could. “Come 
on, we’ll get outside and see if 
we’re in sight of the domes.” 

I lifted Grenville again, while 
he protested vigorously that one 
leg was enough to get around on 
in the light gravity. 

“You won’t be able to do any- 
thing when we get outside, any- 
way,” he added. “The horizon 
will be too close for us to see 
more than a mile or so away. 
We’ll just have to wait for them 
to come and get us. There’s not 
a chance of us finding the domes 
ourselves.” 

By this time, Dagmar had the 
outer door open. The locks of all 
spacecraft open inward to facili-

tate escape in difficult situations, 
as well as to use the air pressure 
to keep them tightly closed in 
space. In this case, it was cer- 
tainly handy. 

Titan’s surface is predominant- 
ly ice, with a lot of ammonium 
carbonate and ammonia incor- 
porated into the ice. Our nearly 
red-hot ship had struck with the 
obvious result. I estimated we 
had sunk about ten feet into the 
ice, so that, if the airlock door 
had opened outward, I couldn’t 
have squeezed through to cut 
steps up to the surface. 

I lifted Grenville on to the ice, 
climbed down again and reached 
back fb help Dagmar. She took 
my hand, raced lightly up ahead 
of me, and gave a relieved smile. 
We looked eagerly about us for 
signs of life. 

I hoisted myself atop the hull, 
but could still see only the jagged 
ice mountains, glinting in the 
cold white light of the distant 
Sun. I slid back to join the others. 

Dagmar, I think, was about to 
make some sarcastic remark 
about my choice of a destination 
or Grenville’s skill as a pilot, 
when our radios came to life. 

“Hello, spaceship! Is anyone 
receiving me? Are you all right?” 

I motioned the others to quiet- 
ness and answered. “Spaceship 
Ether Master here. We are get- 
ting you. We’re down in the ice. 
The ship is a wreck and the 



pilot’s hurt, but we’re all alive. 
Can you pick us up?” 

“I hear you, Ether Master. We 
are coming for you in a crawler. 
We should reach you in about 
fifteen minutes.” 

“Thank God!” Dagmar ex- 
claimed. “Civilization!” 

We heard a voice exclaim, “A 
woman!” and then we settled 
down to wait for our rescuers. 

t ■ iHE noise of their antiquated 
machine carried on the thin 
cold air, and we could hear them 
coming, even through our heavy 
helmets, long before we could see 
them. Then at last they appear- 
ed, grinding their way toward us 
in a cloud of pulverized ice. 

The crawler was a hybrid mon- 
strosity obviously built here in 
the colony, where workshop fa- 
cilities were limited, and design- 
ed to operate in the fantastic 
conditions of Man’s most distant 
outpost. Its ribbed metal treads 
were each thirty inches wide. Its 
riveted body could not have 
weighed less than fifty Earth 
tons and, as it rumbled along, it 
dropped patches of some black 
low-temperature lubricant on the 
ice behind it. 

It lurched to a halt a few yards 
from us, and a dense cloud began 
to form about twenty feet above 
its vertical exhaust pipe. With a 
bang, the front dropped open, 
and a figure, moving with the

ease of long familiarity with his 
old-fashioned spacesuit, strode 
toward us. 

“Welcome to the last frontier, 
friends!” boomed a great voice 
in our helmets. “Tell us what 
brings you to the forgotten colo- 
ny. Who did you kill? Or are you 
just in quest of the simple life?” 

“I am Wolseley Clemmenceton, 
President of the Triplanetary Re- 
public, and my companions are 
the Lady Dagmar Educe and 
Major Grenville, who is hurt,” 
I announced formally. 

A second, somewhat slighter 
figure joined the first and ex- 
claimed: “Ha! The biter bit! We 
hope you’ll be happy here. You’ll 
probably become President, of the 
Titan Political Exiles Club if a 
Navy cruiser doesn’t come for 
you first.” 

I peered at his helmeted face 
and struggled to place the voice. 
Then I remembered. 

“Carter, Director of Venus!” 

“An honor to be remembered 
by my — ah — successor, I am 
sure.” 

Dagmar gave a short nasty 
laugh. Carter spoke again. 

“A few years on Titan rub 
away a lot of the petty motiva- 
tions that dominate the inner 
planet way of life, Clemmence- 
ton. Out here, we no longer have 
vast empires and millions of sub- 
jects to fight over. We will prob- 
ably get along well.” 



“How cozy!” commented Dag- 
mar. 

“Now that the little pleasan- 
tries have been concluded,” I said, 
“I would like to get my pilot to 
a medical man as soon as I can.” 

“All right, everybody into the 
crawler,” said Carter’s compan- 
ion, and turned to give me a hand 
with Grenville. 

Vw 7E clanked up the sloping 
’ ’ front, set Grenville down on 
the only bit of unobstructed floor 
space in the cabin — directly 
behind the driver’s seat — and 
Carter started the small motor 
hauling up the drop-front. 

His companion introduced him- 
self: “My name is Joe Gunn, 
folks. If you think we’d better 
get your friend out of his suit, we 
can seal this cabin and fill it with 
air. It’s not regular practice be- 
cause oxygen-methane mixtures 
are touchy, and it’s more efficient 
to run these things full of meth- 
ane and wear.suits. We can do it 
easy enough when it’s necessary, 
though — just blow the methane 
out with nitrogen from the cyl- 
inder before bringing up the oxy- 
gen concentration, so we don’t 
get an explosion mixture in the 
cabin.” 

I looked at Grenville. His face 
looked very white in its fishbowl, 
and though obviously fully con- 
scious — he had helped us get him 
into the vehicle — he had not 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




spoken since we left the ship. 

“I think we should have an- 
other look at that tourniquet, old 
man,” I said. 

Grenville nodded, and I saw 
that his teeth were still clamped 
together. I turned to Gunn. 

“Get this contraption rolling 
while you blow the methane out, 
will you, please? And is there any 
first-aid equipment aboard?” 

The clumsy machine lurched 
and began to swing about, with 
Carter at the controls. A shrill 
whistle told us Gunn was chang- 
ing the air. They weren’t much 
help in the way of medical sup- 
plies, however. 

“Our first-aid equipment con- 
sists of adhesive patches for 
stopping suit leaks,” Gunn ex- 
plained. 

I eased Grenville’s leg out of 
the suit and loosened the tourni- 
quet for a moment. Dagmar look- 
ed away quickly. Gunn squatted 
beside us. 

“You may hose that leg, fella,” 
he said quietly. 

“At the moment, I’d be glad 
to,” Grenville gritted. 

I was glad to hear him say 
something, a reaction which made 
me realize how much I had come 
to depend on him since the in- 
surrection. 

I looked at his thigh. It was 
certainly a mess. The sooner it 
was getting proper attention, the 
better I would like it. 



rriHE noise Gunn made moving 
around caused me to look up. 
“Now that we’re well on our 
way, I thought I’d break out 
some rations,” he said. “See what 
you think of our local version of 
coffee and biscuits.” 

“What kind of state of affairs 
did you leave behind you, Clem- 
menceton?” Carter asked over his 
shoulder. 

“A fantastic botch. Hasn’t any 
news of it come out here?” 

“Not in the past six Earth 
months. Your lunar station quit 
beaming messages out here at 
the end of February.” 

“That was just about when 
things began to get really out of 
hand. Right up to the end, we 
were holding our own on Mars 
and Venus, but Terra was a caul- 
dron of fury. The Emindale in- 
terests engineered the big pro- 
tein crisis around the middle of 
last year, and Jockatra riots, fol- 
lowed. Grellet got control of the 
Public Order Force, through his 
dummy, Me Cardie, and built it 
up to face the so-called threat of 
the civil disorders his own agents 
were stirring up. 

“It was plain by then that more 
than just the usual pressure tac- 
tics and maneuverings of various 
interests were in progress. While 
I was occupied with this side of 
the plot, the Gordinester family 
acquired control of the spacelines. 
I caught onto the trend of the

whole thing too late. I declared 
martial law and tried to strong- 
arm my way through, but their 
planning had been too thorough. 
It was impossible to keep control 
on Earth, and their stranglehold 
on interplanetary travel prevent- 
ed us from drawing support from 
Mars and Venus. The administra- 
tion collapsed and its members 
scattered.” 

‘‘You always saw yourself as 
a twenty-third-century Julius 
Caesar,” said Carter, “unifying 
and inspiring a republic torn by 
civil war and overrun with 
corrupt officials, didn’t you, 
Clemmenceton? We had a self- 
contained highly mechanized and 
developed culture on Venus, had 
cut our ties with a decadent Earth 
which was unable even to keep 
order at home at that stage, and 
could have preserved our achieve- 
ments almost indefinitely if you 
hadn’t forced us back into the 
Republic at gun-point. I gather 
your attempted strong-arm tac- 
tics failed. Apparently you re- 
unified the Solar System only so 
it could all collapse together.” 

¥ SHOOK my head stubbornly, 
•* as argumentative as if on a 
TV debate. 

“Someone had to try to restore 
central government, Carter. 
‘When the government is weak, 
the people are oppressed’, as Ana- 
tole France put it. Your ‘highly 



developed’ Venusian culture was 
completely static. Earth and 
Mars, where life was easier, were 
slipping back fast. For eleven 
years, I held the Republic to- 
gether by playing one interest 
against another, and broke up 
the private armies with the threat 
of the bombardment squadrons. 

“It was always a precarious 
balance, but while it lasted the 
Interplanet rocket services kept 
regular schedules again, and the 
Lunar Station kept beaming. If 
I hadn’t grasped the reins when 
I did, there would h'ave been no 
space communications at all in 
a few more years.” 

Carter grinned. “You consider, 
then, that the day of the bow and 
arrow and the hand-plough will 
return soon, now that the Re- 
public is deprived of your guid- 
ing hand?” 

“We shall see. Old Grellet is 
as cunning as they come, but I 
cannot see him holding the Presi- 
dency for any length of time. The 
very forces he used to upset my 
administration must inevitably 
destroy him. The powerful fami- 
lies were his allies against me, 
but they will not submit to his 
rule. Nor will the mobs he stirred 
up with promises of restoring the 
old freedoms and luxuries of last 
century. 

“His polygot following of in- 
compatibles was united only 
against my government. With 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




that destroyed, they must be 
tearing at each other right now. 
Even if it has the strength to ride 
the storm, it will be a strife-torn 
and weakened Republic that he 
rules. I could never imagine him 
being able to spare a cruiser to 
come out here after me.” 

“But then you never managed 
to spare one to chase me, either,” 
Carter said softly, and chuckled. 

The crawler lurched on, and, 
lost in introspection, I did not 
answer. 

“Mr. Gunn, would you help me 
get these boots off, please?” 

Dagmar, naturally. It was her 
typical reaction to being ignored. 

Big Joe Gunn bent down and 
loosened the straps, and held the 
boots one at a time while she 
withdrew her feet. Removing 
spaceboots is a process that is 
little bother to perform for one- 
self. I watched with the mild in- 
terest of one who views still 
another variation played on a 
familiar theme. Carter looked 
back to see what was going on, 
and laughed loudly. Gunn glared 
at him. 

“How far to Morgan?” I asked 
Carter. 

“If you come up forward here, 
you can see two of the domes 
just beyond that big outcrop,” 
he replied. 

“Good. Can you call ahead and 
get a doctor to stand by for 
Grenville?” 

FAiR FROM THE WARMING 



“I’ve done that. There will be 
a welcoming committee for you, 
too.” His voice was quite expres- 
sionless, and I found it impos- 
sible to read his meaning. 

Dagmar paused in arranging 
her hair and looked at me. I 
shrugged and smiled slightly. 
Gunn, holding her handkerchief, 
resumed the task she had given 
him of removing smudges of dirt 
from her face. 

A couple of minutes later, we 
were at the airlock of the largest 
dome. 

W7E three inner-planet people 
™ stared about us like tourists. 
Morgan consisted of eight domes, 
varying between two -hundred 
and five-hundred meters in diam- 
eter, and connected by low, cov- 
ered passageways. Between each 
dome and the surrounding ice 
was a thick rim of some non-me- 
tallic material, which in most 
cases projected two to three feet 
from the ground, and up to 
which ramps had been built to 
the airlocks. 

Our clumsy vehicle rolled up 
one of these, through the outer 
doorway, and halted before the 
inner. It took several minutes to 
pump the methane from the lock 
and flood it with air, and then 
the inner door opened and we 
drove into the dome proper. 

“Usually we leave these things 
outside,” Carter explained. “They 



SUN 



95 




take up too much room in the 
domes, but at the moment this is 
the gentlest way of getting your 
pilot into the right hands.” 
“Good. Thanks for the consid- 
eration, Carter.” 

When we dropped the front of 
the crawler, we were met by the 
doctor and the committee Carter 
had spoken of. Nothing was said 
until the doctor, a heavily built 
man, past middle-age and with 
■coarse ruddy features, had Gren- 
ville loaded on a wheeled stretch- 
er and taken away. Then I looked 



up at the three men who stood 
waiting nearby. 

“You wish to talk business, 
gentlemen?” I inquired. 

“Yes, Clemmenceton,” the fore- 
most answered. “There are cer- 
tain formalities to be attended 
to. You have met Mr. Carter, I 
see. This is Mr. Pelotzi and this 
is Mr. Brown. I am Rodericks, 
the Mayor. The four of us, to- 
gether with Mr. Velez and Mr. 
Goth, who are busy elsewhere, 
constitute the Council which ad- 
ministers Morgan Settlement. To

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




us, then, you and your compan- 
ions may address a request to be 
allowed to take up residence in 
the Independency.” 

“What is the correct formula? 
We, Wolseley Clemmenceton, 
Dagmar Educe and Martin Gren- 
ville, hereby request — ” 

“Yes, that’ll do. Now, in order 
to compensate the people of the 
Independency for accepting you, 
what have you to offer?” 

“What? What use have you for 
Republican man-hour credits 
when there’s no intercourse be- 
tween here and the Republic? Or 
do you mean what skills have we 
to place at the colony’s disposal?” 
“Neither. You came in a space- 
ship which is now lying slightly 
battered some miles out there.” 
He waved an arm in the direction 
we had come from. “To us, that 
ship represents a fortune in heavy 
machinery which we have inade- 
quate facilities to make ourselves. 
To you, it is a wreck and nothing 
more. Add to this the fact that 
you are not in a position to bar- 
gain, and I think you will agree 
that it is not an unreasonable 
price for citizenship.” 

The man introduced as Brown, 
tall, dark and about forty, nod- 
ded at me and took up the con- 
versation. 

“I won’t blame you if you call 
this outright piracy, but piracy 
of one sort or another has always 
been a government’s prerogative. 



When you have seen a bit of our 
way of life here, you will under- 
stand that we have to drive hard 
bargains to maintain a reasonable 
living standard for all. Now 
what’s your answer?” 

T GAVE him what I imagine 
looked like a rather sardonic 
smile. 

“Your price is accepted,” I 
said. “I have driven some hard 
bargains myself in my time and 
don’t expect charity. The ship is 
yours. Now you can tell us some- 
thing of our rights and responsi- 
bilities as Titanian citizens.” 

Carter answered me. “It’s all 
pretty straightforward. Everyone 
works. Many of us have two jobs 
and some have more. The stand- 
ard of living is higher than most 
inner- planet people seem to think, 
however. You understand, of 
course, that if an armed ship ar- 
rives to take you back to the 
Republic, no attempt will be 
made to protect or hide you. Is 
that clear?” 

“Fair enough,” I replied. “Well, 
now that that’s settled, I’d like 
to see how Grenville is getting 
along. Was he taken to a hospital 
or don’t you have any?” 

“One moment. We have to vote 
on your admission. All in favor? 
Carried. Carter, will you take 
Clemmenceton to the hospital? 
I’ll get citizenship papers made 
out presently. No hurry. Gunn, 



98

$ 

where are you going with that 
woman?” 

“Going to show her around the 
domes,” said Gunn. “Any objec- 
tions?” 

“That depends on Mr. Clem- 
menceton,” Rodericks answered. 
“It’s his affair, it seems to me.” 

They waited for my comment, 
Dagmar challenging me silently 
to refuse. 

“No objection whatever,” I 
said. “Go right ahead. Mr. Carter, 
I’m ready if you are.” 

Carter took me down a kind of 
thoroughfare between the rows of 
boxlike homes, factories, store- 
houses and office buildings. The 
entire inside of the dome was 
floored with the same mottled 
brown material we had noticed 
between the smooth painted white 
of the dome and the outside ice. 

“It’s the best insulator we’ve 
got,” Carter explained. “We could 
stand a lot higher heat loss than 
we have at the moment, but if we 
passed much more heat than we 
do out through the bases and 
walls of the domes, the whole 
setup would just melt its way 
right down to the core of the 
satellite and let the ice close again 
over it.” 

“Oh,” I said, “I see. The case of 
the missing colony, eh?” 

“The next place down here is 
the hospital. Doc Hawthorn and 
his wife and their three daugh- 
ters live in and run the place. The 



Doc learned his profession here, 
by the way. He’s never been off 
Titan in his life.” 

“What’s that? University train- 
ing here?” 

“Oh, Lord, no. Everything is on 
the apprenticeship system. We’ve 
made it work surprisingly well, 
you know. Medicine, of course, 
is the worst off. There are hardly 
any books, no experimental ani- 
mals at all and very few facili^ 
ties. A youngster just has to pick 
it up by working under the old 
doctor. Rather hard on the pa- 
tient at times, but successful on 
the whole. The two kids studying 
under Hawthorn these days are 
both promising youngsters. They 
are probably getting a lesson in 
fracture and arterial bleeding 
right now.” 

I felt some misgivings about 
the treatment Grenville would be 
receiving. 

“There was something else that 
caught my attention in that re- 
mark of yours,” I said. “Your 
mention of the three daughters of 
the doctor living at home. I 
should imagine there would still 
be a heavy preponderence of 
menfolk here. How come there 
are three unattached women?” 

“A conclusion wrongly jumped 
to, old man. The daughters are 
all married and there are a cou- 
ple of kids running about the 
place. The men go out to work 
and their wives do a good job of

combining domestic and nursing 
duties. The family group like 
that is the natural economic and 
social unit here. The shortage of 
living space keeps the group to- 
gether even when it gets bigger.” 

W ITH the excitement of the 
crash and the bumpy trip 
to the settlement now some time 
behind me, I was beginning for 
the first time to be really curious 
about the way these people lived. 
I wondered what kind of future 
they looked forward to, and I 
asked Carter. 

“We look to the future a great 
deal. More than you would think, 
I suppose. With a bigger popula- 
tion, we could do more and life 
would be better for everyone. 
You will notice it in the colonists’ 
attitudes. Your bringing a mis- 
tress along, for instance, will be 
distinctly disapproved of.” 
“Small-town morality.” 

“No, not a bit. Children are all- 
important to our way of think- 
ing, and relationships like yours 
are not usually productive. That’s 
the only reason.” 

“Hm. I always wanted children 
myself, but there were so many 
things against it. Now I probably 
never will have them. Dagmar 
doesn’t want a child. There were 
other women back on Earth. I 
might have married, left an 
heir — ” 

“I don’t think Lady Dagmar 



will like the colony. I doubt if 
it will like her.” 

I smiled at him. “You’re get- 
ting old, Carter. More so than I 
am, apparently. Didn’t you no- 
tice Gunn’s reaction? Dagmar 
might not like the colony, but 
her wiles work as well here as 
anywhere else. I wonder what ef- 
fect she’s having on Gunn right 
now.” 

He looked at me intently for a 
moment. He wonders how jealous 
I am, 1 thought. Then he looked 
away and silently continued lead- 
ing me through the settlement. 

The hospital was a square 
building of about average size for 
the dome we were in. It had two 
stories, the lower of which was 
devoted to beds, an operating 
theater and a dispensary. The 
second story was the living quar- 
ters of the Hawthorns. 

Carter knocked perfunctorily 
and we walked straight in. 

“General ward,” Carter ex- 
plained over his shoulder. “Sur- 
gery this way.” 

npHERE were half a dozen beds 
in the outer room, two of 
them occupied by men who eyed 
us curiously as we passed through, 
and one bed was screened off. The 
place was clean and everything 
in it was neatly arranged. As 
i I looked at the plain iron bed- 
steads with their coarse white 
bedding, I grew more aware of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

the isolation of this colony and 
its continual battle with its un- 
friendly surroundings. They had 
kept it free of the mental decay 
that had destroyed the spirit of 
enterprise and respect for ethical 
standards among the peoples of 
the more comfortable inner plan- 
ets. 

We knocked on the surgery 
door, a thin sheet of plastic in a 
metal frame, like most of the 
doors on this world, constructed 
without wood. 

“Carter and your patient’s 
friend; we’ve come to see how the 
injured pilot is getting on,” Car- 
ter answered to an inarticulate 
inquiring noise from within. 

“Come in. He’ll live.” 

We did so, to see Grenville 
with a trussed-up leg, Hawthorn 
with a satisfied expression on his 
face, two young men — both, I 
should say, aboyt twenty-two or 
three — who were apparently the 
apprentice doctors, and a girl in 
white who, I supposed, was one 
of Hawthorn’s daughters. 

“Nastiest compound • fracture 
I’ve seen in years,” the medical 
man said to us. “He’s upt in any 
danger df losing the leg now, but 
it probably won’t ever fully re- 
cover. The broken bone has done 
a lot of damage to the nerves in 
the forward part of the thigh. 
Still, I think we can patch him 
up well enough to make a useful 
citizen of him again.” 



Grenville smiled a little grim- 
ly. “How useful a citizen will a 
space pilot with only one good 
leg make?” 

Hawthorne frowned at him. 

“Don’t cast aspersions on my 
ability, young man. You’ll have 
two good legs. One of them just 
won’t be up to carrying you 
around on hundred-meter dashes 
and so forth. You’ll only be able 
to catch the women that want to 
be caught from now on.” 

“Well, Grenville,” I said, “look 
after yourself, and do what the 
doctor tells you. Dagmar and I 
will get settled somewhere — I 
think she is out laying the 
groundwork for herself, anyway, 
at the moment — then, when we’ve 
found out what the settlement 
expects of us, we’ll pay you a 
social call. You will probably be 
given something like a plant op- 
erator’s job. What I shall do, I 
don’t know. My trade is politics, 
but I think there would be some 
objections to my practicing it 
here.” 

Carter looked up, an unfathom- 
able expression on his face for a 
moment. 

“All right now,” the doctor 
said. “Clear out, all of you. We 
have Work to do. Visiting horn’s 
are over.” 

“Right,” I answered. “See you 
later, Grenville. I dare say it 
won’t be long before you’re up 
and about again.”

A FTER we left, I asked Carter 
how we would get on for ac- 
commodations. 

“Mayor Rodericks is getting 
something lined up for you, I 
think, though Lady Dagmar ap- 
pears to have ideas of her own on 
that score. She seems to be trying 
to talk Joe Gunn into taking her 
in.’.’ 

He watched me closely for a 
reaction. I grunted noncommit- 
tally. Dagmar’s conduct was not 
altogether surprising to anyone 
who knew her as well as I did. 
At the moment, she was furious 
that she had allowed herself to 
become involved in my misfor- 
tunes, and was seeking comfort 
in the attentions of a young and 
good-looking admirer. What her 
next move would be, however, I 
doubted if she knew herself. 

Carter and I turned a corner 
and almost collided with the 
councilor named Pelotzi. 

“Ah!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been 
looking for you. We checked up 
on living space and we find that 
we can give the three of you 
rooms in Residence Four in 
Aaron Dome. That’s the small 
one, over there.” 

“Thank you. Councilor,” I 
said. “It may be some time be- 
fore Major Grenville can be 
moved from the hospital, but I 
shall go to the quarters myself 
as soon as I can. Whether the ar- 
rangements will suit Lady Dag- 



mar or not, I cannot say.” 

He coughed apologetically. “I 
am afraid they will have to, Mr. 
Clemmenceton. There is no other 
place available.” 

Carter and I both smiled. 

“Can I get over and have a 
look around now?” I asked. 

“Certainly, Mr. Clemmenceton. 
I’m sure Mr. Carter will take you 
there.” 

“Does every new arrival upset 
the whole system of government 
like this? I mean get personally 
shown to his quarters by the Im- 
migration Secretary or whatever 
you are?” 

“Well, it’s three Earth years 
since the last ship came out this 
way, so there’s no great strain 
involved,” Carter answered. 

Pelotzi left us, and Carter re- 
sumed his role of guide. We pass- 
ed through the connecting 
passageway with its airtight bulk- 
heads at each end, and entered 
Aaron Dome. 

“Aaron is mainly residential 
buildings,” said Carter, “except 
for a couple of places over there 
where we do a bit of air process- 
ing. This is Residence Four right 
here.” 

TTE opened one of the now fa- 
•*- miliar metal-framed plastic 
doors, and we entered a small 
foyer in which was an unattend- 
ed desk. Taking a book from it, 
he leafed through the pages to

find the numbers of the unoccu- 
pied rooms. 

“Third floor,” he said, pencil- 
ing something in the book. “A 
bedroom each) and a bathroom 
and lounge that you’ll share with 
the other couple on the floor. We 
can’t afford to waste any space, 
but we’re not really badly 
crowded.” 

“From all appearances, I’d say 
you lived pretty well out here.” 

“We do all right. Consumer 
goods are scarce — all those things 
that are mass-produced so cheap- 
ly on the inner planets — and we 
lack adequate school and medical 
facilities. Just the same, the ne- 
cessities of life are in reasonable 
supply, and we have a bit of 
leisure time, and a few luxuries.” 

“I can’t tell you how impressed 
I am by the way you’ve got the 
technical side of things sewn up. 
Back on Earth, I knew you’d 
had no supply ship for three 
years, but I just didn’t realize 
what that implied. I think I pic- 
tured Titan as an out-of-the-way 
colony of shaggy hillbillies, grad- 
ually reverting to savagery on a 
bleak, unfriendly world.” 

“Ha! You missed the point. In 
a really hostile setting like this, 
you either keep your technology 
up to the mark or die. That’s why 
this settlement won’t ever slip 
into decadence, even if all the 
rest of the Solar System does. And 
there’s another reason, too— the 



kind of people who’ve been able 
to adapt themselves to life on 
Titan are not the ones to sit idly 
by and watch their world fall 
apart. The pioneering stock, the 
misfits from the more ordered 
and organized and safer life of 
the inner worlds, generations of 
political refugees, they’ve built a 
world that can look forward when 
civilization everywhere else is 
crumbling from the <Jry rot. 

“Take the emphasis on chil- 
dren here that I was telling you 
about. The bigger our population 
gets, the more specialization is 
possible and the better life be- 
comes for everyone. Well, any- 
way, here’s the Presidential Suite, 
so I’ll cut the sales talk.” 

I took the irony in good part. 
He selected a key, opened the 
door, and we both went in. 

“Here are your keys,” he said, 
and handed them to me. “There 
are crawlers out already to bring 
your ship to the domes for strip- 
ping, so you’ll be able to rescue 
your personal effects before long.”

T GLANCED around the quar- 
ters and was pleasantly sur- 
prised by their undeniably plain 
but eminently comfortable-look-

thing in sight was made of one 
plastic or another. 

Carter told me more about the 
colony’s industry : 

“We’ve all the power we want

from big hydrogen - powered 
spaceship engines. Ice, ammonia 
and methane are our main raw 
materials, with the metals at a 
premium. We do a bit of direct 
synthesis for some foodstuffs and 
our plastics and textiles, but most 
of our complex organics come 
from the culture vats. At present, 
we’re trying to develop a strain 
of—” 

The door was thrown violently 
open to admit an apologetic 
Pelotzi, driven before one of Dag- 
mar’s most violent rages. Seeing 
me, she switched targets. 

“You, you walking antique, you 
drag me away from a life on a 
civilized world where I had every 
comfort and attention to a col- 
lection of huts on a chunk of 
ice millions of miles from any- 
where! And that animal, Gunn! 
Then they can’t give me any- 
where to live and they expect me 
to live with you! I must have 
been mad to ever get — ” 

“There, there, old girl, you'll 
shock' the hillbillies,” I said. 

„ Carter laughed uproariously. 
Dagmar picked up a heavy 
carved plastic ornament and 
threw it at him, hitting him on 
the shoulder as he made a belated 
attempt to jump aside. Then she 
turned on me again. She sprang 
like a tiger, and I caught her, 
wrists to save my face from being, 
clawed. She kicked my shins. 
Carter was still laughing, while 



Pelotzi stood by, looking very 
embarrassed. 

I was not really angry. I had 
been through some tense experi- 
ences in the last few months, and 
I think they had tended to de- 
prive my always fairly unexcit- 
able disposition of some of its 
capacity for resentment, at least 
for the time being. I grasped both 
her small wrists in my left hand, 
drew back my right, and hit her 
carefully several times across the 
face. 

She screamed and kicked with 
increased violence for a moment 
or two, then subsided, sobbing. I 
spoke to her quietly. 

“You're misleading yourself, 
my darling. You’re forgetting the 
raging mobs too easily. You 
would have been as violently used 
as I would have, if they’d been 
able to lay hands on you. 

“You remember the form Grel- 
let’s line took. All the ills of the 
times were due to the lustful and 
irresponsible dictator, meaning 
me, who was impoverishing three 
worlds to rain jewels upon his 
avaricious mistress, meaning you.” 

QHE had become quieter. Her 
^ hands still clenched and un- 
clenched, and her body shook, 
but her eyes were closed.

certain, had I been taken,” I 
went on. “But imagine the mob’s

She clung to me. She looked up 
for a moment, disheveled blonde 
hair streaked down over tear- 
dirtied face, and smiled as our 
eyes met. 

“Morgan Settlement may be no 
tropic island paradise, but it’s 
no penal colony, either. This 
apartment could be fitted up 
to—” 

Then she dropped her head 
against my chest again and cried 
unrestrainedly. 

Carter took Pelotzi’s arm and 
started to propel him from the 
room. 

“It’s all display,” I explained 
amusedly. “Don’t let it worry 
you. Some people call it Irish 
courtship. Freud wrote books 
about it.” 

He closed the door. 

It had been more than thirteen 
years since we had first known 
each other, but there is nothing 
like violent emotional disturb- 
ance to restore for a night the 
passion of departed youth. 

/BARTER called in again at ten- 
^ thirty the next morning, 
showing for once a politician’s 
tact by not coming earlier. 
Though his greeting was cheerily 
informal, he had the manner of a 
man come to talk hard-headed 
business. 

“Well, have you got your do- 
mestic affairs settled?” he asked. 

“More or less. I’m expecting.” 



“Good God, that was quick!” 
“Oh, it might take a couple of 
years. I mean I’ve assured my- 
self of the opportunity to keep 
trying.” 

“I see. Well, that’s fine. Now, 
then, the reason for this visit. 
You were talking of ‘practicing 
your trade,’ as you put it. Well — ” 
he gestured me to silence as I 
started to interrupt — “that is 
exactly what we want you to do. 
Take a post on the Federal Coun- 
cil. We’re not afraid you’ll try 
to make yourself dictator of Titan 
and set out to reconquer your 
lost Empire. Neither am I op- 
posed to the idea on the grounds 
of old antagonisms. I never did 
and still don’t like a lot of things 
abdut you and about your view 
of — well, everything. But, like the 
other councilors here, I realize 
how much help your adminis- 
trative ability can be to us. 

“The five Titanian settlements 
are largely self-governing, but 
do owe allegiance in some matters 
to a Federal Council. The prob- 
lems of governing such a con- 
federacy are enormous, as I 
suppose you can imagine.” 

“Hold on a minute!” I said, 
suddenly remembering one of the 
problems. “If radio here is limited 
to line of sight, how did we get 
Gunn’s call from the crawler?” 
“Rocket-aerials. All the crawl- 
ers have them so they can call

below their horizons. A small 
rocket carries a fine silver aerial 
up to about two and a half miles. 
That gives a radius of about a 
hundred miles, or two hundred 
if both sender and receiver have 
aerials up.” 

“Oh. Very clever. Well, keep 
talking. What other troubles are 
you letting me in for?” 

“Apart from the griefs stem- 
ming from the environment, the 
usual run of small-time political 
feuds, nepotism, intercolony jeal- 
ousies, everyqne trying to get 
more of scarce materials than he’s 
entitled to.” 

“What’s the setup of the coun- 
cil itself? Is it elected, appointed, 
or what?” 

“Elected, nominally. Each col- 
ony has its representatives. We 
won’t have any trouble getting 
you in if you decide to accept, 
though.” 

T FROWNED and looked as if 
I were thinking deeply, but 
my mind was made up, natur- 
ally. 

“I accept, Carter. You know, 
things are working out better for 
me than I had any right to hope 
for. What deposed autocrat, 
after deposition and barely get- 
ting away with his life, has ever 
been offered a respectable polit- 
ical appointment in a culture 
which may not be materially 
prosperous, but is definitely sound 



and is progressing, and been able 
also to carry a beautiful woman 
away with him to share his exile 
and raise his family in middle- 
class respectability?” 

Carter’s answer was a slight, 
thin-lipped smile. I read the im- 
plication behind it with little 
difficulty. 

“Oh, I have a fair idea of your 
opinion of Dagmar, but you do 
her injustice.” Pictures and frag- 
ments of reminiscences, some 
clear, some half-faded, were be- 
fore me as I spoke. I was going 
to become a minor politician, 
with a host of routine duties. 
Well, there is more to life than 
merely satisfying ambition. What 
is a man whose personality is 
totally submerged in his am- 
bition? Yet had I ever been truly 
ambitious? Who knows his own 
desires, at any time? 

Carter smiled still, and I con- 
tinued.

she was the most talked-of beauty 
of the nobility. Yet she was a 
rebel even then against the caste-

“Mr. Carter! Mr. Carter! The 
Space Field Tower has spotted 
a ship approaching! A big one!” 

The young colonial who had 
run up with the message was 
puffing hard and trying to get 
his breath back. My stomach felt 
cold. I realized with a jar the 
extent to which overconfidence 
makes men vulnerable to emo- \ 
tional shock. 

“It looks as though you were 
wrong, Clemmenceton — you’ll 
have to face the music,” Carter 
said softly. 

“My judgment appears to have 
been badly astray,” I replied, my 
voice flat and expressionless, and 
speaking half to myself. 

I honestly never believed they 
had the remotest chance of keep- 
ing the peace in their own do- 
mains with the forces at their 
command, let alone being able to 
spare a cruiser to come out this 
far after me. But very evidently 
they had. 

“Well, perhaps my personal 
misfortune should be weighed 
against the return of stable gov- 
ernment to the inner planet peo- 
ple,” I murmured. I imagined the 
planets torn by rioting, mob vio- 
lence, and countless pitched bat- 
tles. “It just shows how a man 
will overestimate his own import- 
ance.” 



rvAGMAR had come quietly 
from the bedroom, and I was 
not aware of her presence until I 
felt her gently rest her hand on 
my arm. 

“And we weren’t even un- 
packed,” she said. “Wolseley, 
there’s no need to say anything 
about Grenville. They won’t be 
looking for him and he wasn’t 
really playing empire-builders 
with us.” Carter was looking at 
her intently. “We’ll p’robably have 
a more comfortable trip back in 
the cruiser’s brig than we had 
coming out in the Master's cabin, 
anyway.” 

“The tower says they should 
have contact with the ship in not 
much over an hour,” the mes- 
senger said. 

Dagmar whirled to face him. 
“You mean you haven’t spoken 
to them yet? You don’t really 
know what they want? What’s 
the idea? Are you just trying 
to give Wolseley and me a 
fright?” 

“I’m sorry, Mrs. Clemmence- 
ton,” he answered, and I smiled 
at the form of address, “but there 
has been no contact between Ti- 
tan and the inner worlds for over 
half a year now, and there was 
little enough before that. There 
could be no other reason for a 
big ship coming now.” 

Then her eyes filled and I put 
one arm around her and held her 
close. 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN

Carter turned to me and said, 
“I regret this. We could have 
used you to such good purpose. 
We’ve got a world to run, with 
underpopulation and a shortage 
of machinery and a hostile en- 
vironment to battle against. I 
wish we could give you sanctuary, 
Clemmenceton, but we just can’t 
afford to antagonize the • inner 
world military. We’re quite de- 
fenseless here, you see.” 

I suppose at that moment my 
feelings were a chaotic admix- 
ture. There was a kind of help- 
less cold fury at being so sud- 
denly deprived of the refuge in 
which I had felt myself safe, an 
angry contempt for Carter and 
the colonials of Titan for their 
fear of Grellet’s ship. Of course 
I was aware that this anger 
sprang from my own position, 
but that did not lessen the feel-' 
ing any. And there was a kind 
of resignation to the inevitable 
— and also a lot of gratitude to 
Dagmar for the way she was tak- 
ing the ship’s arrival. 

“Let’s go to the' tower,” I said. 

“Yes, I suppose we might as 
well. It would be humiliating to 
be taken to the ship under guard. 
Wait while I put some makeup 
on.” 

“The reaction,” I told Carter, 
“is typical. At times it has been 
an attitude which has infuriated 
me, but, at the moment, I like 
it,” 

no 



S HE was only gone a moment, 
however. I looked at her close 
ly when she reappeared. She was 
as lovely as I had ever seen her. 
The light slack -suit, as affected 
by the settlement women, was 
not unbecoming, and together 
with the way her long light- 
brown hair was pulled back and 
held by clips, and the lightly 
applied makeup, it made her look 
very young. Carter’s face seemed 
to express cynicism, and I think 
embarrassment, as I kissed her 
and we set put for the tower. 

The “space field” was an ar- 
bitrarily defined area of , ice, and 
the tower a plastic affair, rising 
about two hundred feet into.’ the 
poisonous air. 

In the hemispherical, trans- 
parent room at the top were two 
men, one of whom had earphones 
on and sat at the radio table. 
The second turned to face us. 

“No communication with them 
yet, Mr. Carter, though they’re 
well within Morse range. In fact, 
I’d say now that they are in 
verbal range — 

“Quiet, I’m getting something!” 
interrupted the man wearing the 
- phones. 

He stretched out his left arm 
and cut in the loudspeaker on 
the wall. Through a storm of 
crackling and whistling came a 
man’s voice. 

_ “ — Settlement. Hello, Morgan 
Settlement. Spaceship Pax Re- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




publics calling. Space — crackle, 
crackle — Republics seeking per- 
mission to land with a hundred 
and twenty refugees from Earth. 
Seeking — ” 

Dagmar’s shriek obliterated the 
repeat, and she began to pummel 
my arm and back, incoherently 
exclaiming a series of “We 
needn’t go back”s and “I said it 
couldn’t be a warship”s and simi- 
lar things. 

I just suddenly relaxed. The 
shocks were coming in too rapid 
a succession to be appreciated as 
they happened. 

“They’ll make it in about ten or 
twelve hours, I should say,” the 
operator’s assistant said. 

Dagmar and I looked at each 
other, and started back down the 
long stairway. About halfway to 
the bottom was a landing, with a 
big clear port looking out over the 
craggy whiteness. Here we 
paused. 

AS I watched the spectacular 
scintillations of an iceworld 
sunset, my thoughts ran again 
and again over the last hour. 
Here I would still be working 
for something I believed in very 
dearly, though in a small way, 
and without fanfares. Pageantry 
and circumstance, however, I had 
known well, and would not 
mourn their loss. 

Since my first entry into poli- 
tics at the age of eighteen, just 



before the collapse of the Fourth 
Kingdom, I had belonged to 
many parties and known many 
viewpoints. Then I was a pacifist, 
abhorring bloodshed and violence, 
but, like most, I always recog- 
nized the decadence of the times, 
and when the chance came to 
play Caesar, I took it. 

The Empire was still-born, and 
the planets had reverted far 
toward barbarism, but out here, 
beyond the reach of bloody war- 
lords and roving pirates, I would 
play a part in a small culture 
which logically should remain as 
Carter once had hoped his Venus- 
ian state would remain — an iso- 
lated outpost whose people must 
retain their science merely to 
stay alive, and which would sur- 
vive to welcome eventually the 
first contact with a resurgent 
inner-world culture. 

Dagmar turned her gaze from 
the sparkling ice crags, so bril- 
liant beneath their blue-black 
sky, and our eyes met. 

It would be a stoic’s world to 
bring children into, but one where 
hope and ambition were not un- 
known, and one that could offer 
the satisfaction that comes from 
achievement. 

Here I would find my personal 
fulfillment. Here I would see my 
children grow up, on this farthest 
outpost, far from the warming 
Sun.

That opened Bozzy’s other eye. 
“Thank you, dear,” he said. 
“You’re very sweet or very clever.

“I don’t have to be coaxed,” 
Howard announced, sliding to the 
floor with all the covers. “From

dy. Because you’ll be a Senior 
Citizen tomorrow.” 

Bozzy didn’t want to think of 
that just then. “Tell your mother 
I’m up,” he said. “And get out 
so I can bathe and dress.” 

Sophie minced, Howard ran, 
Ralph toddled. 

Bozzy rose, a pudgy man 
slightly under average height at 
six feet two, with blue eyes and 
thinning brown hair. He was ex- 
actly thirty-nine years, eleven 
months, and twenty-nine days 
old. 

And that was the point. At 
forty, he would have to go to 
work. This was his day for job- 
taking. 

He dreaded it. 

TTE put the coming ceremonies 
out of his mind and con- 
centrated on his supersonic bath, 
the depilatory cream, the color 
of his outer clothing. It took time 
to achieve the right shade of 
purple in the bathroom plastic- 
dispenser, but no time at all to 
pour, solidify, and cut the sheet- 



like robe required for the occa- 
sion. 

In it, he was the sensation of 
the breakfast room, handsome as 
a male bird in spring plumage. 
Kate, his slender wife, who had 
been up and at work for an hour, 
looked moth-eaten by compari- 
son, as if their nest had been lined 
with her plucked-out down. 

“You look very attractive this 
morning, Kate,” Bozzy told her. 
He gave her an extra-warm kiss. 

“Well!” she said. “Quite the 
gallant today, aren’t we? Just be 
sure you’re on time today, dar- 
ling. Remember what Mr. Frewne 
had to say about promptness.” 

Frewne. That overinflated 
windbag. The obesity who was 
about to become his boss. With- 
out having worked a day in his 
life, Bozzy found he hated the 
idea of having a boss. 

“Let’s think of something pleas- 
ant,” he grunted, and thought of 
breakfast. 

He took his place at the table. 
Kate and the kids had already 
eaten, so Kate served, while the 
kids, attracted by his .finery, 
stood off and watched him swal- 
low a vitamin pill, a thyroid pill, 
and a Dexedrine pill. 

Solemnly, he opened the three 
eggs Kate brought. Each was 
guaranteed by her to have been 
irradiated for exactly two min- 
utes and fifty-five seconds, and 
guaranteed by the grocer to have

been enriched by feeding the hens 
three kinds of mold. 

His mouth was full of the third 
and last one when Sophie asked, 
“Why do you have to go to work. 
Daddy?” 

The reminder choked him. 
Gulping, he said, “To support us 
all, honey. My pension stops to- 
morrow.” 

“Yes, but I read in a book 
where people used to go to work 
when they were young.” 

He was tempted to say, “I am 
young!” but thought better of 
it. “That was. long ago, dear.” 
“Were people different then?” 
“No, but society was. Our Sen- 
ior Citizens used to be pensioned 
off, while younger people worked. 
But when science improved the 
Seniors’ health, they got tired of 
sitting in corners on pensions 
and, besides, a lot of them died 
soon after they stopped working. 
When it got so that more than 
half of all voters were between 
forty and seventy years old, the 
Seniors voted their pensions to 
the young, to get educated and 
raise families on, and nobody’s 
allowe*d to work till he’s forty. 
Now do you see?” 

“Forty is awful old,” said 
Sophie. 

TIOWARD had meanwhile 
taken his mother’s hand. 
“You're not going to work, are 
you, Mommy?” he asked. 



“Not for ten years, dear. I’ll 
be here when you want me, so 
why don’t you go play on the 
balcony? I’ve got to get Daddy 
off and give Ralph his bath.” 

“I’ll bathe him,” Sophie volun- 
teered. “You help, Howie. We 
can make like we’re young.” 

“Don’t drop him,” Kate 
warned. 

“Clean up the bathroom after- 
ward,” added Bozzy. 

“Yes, sir,” said Howard, for 
the first time in his life. 

The children left, and Kate 
came close to pour Bozzy his cup 
of Daystart. He slipped an arm 
around her waist and squeezed 
convulsively. 

“Darling!” she said, stroking 
his bald spot. “You’re positively 
trembling!” 

“Wouldn’t you be, if you had 
to take over from somebody you 
like as well as I like Mr. Kojac? 
And for no good reason, except 
he’s seventy-five and I’ll soon be 
forty.” 

Kate pushed away from him, 
frowning. “Sometimes you’re so 
silly, it scares me. You know per- 
fectly well that if you don’t take 
Mr. Kojac’s job, someone else 
will. He’d rather have it in your 
hands than in a stranger’s, and 
I’d rather live on his income than 
on a laborer’s. So stop moping 
and drink your Daystart, while 
I call a cab.” 

No help in that quarter, Bozzy 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




decided as she left. All Kate 
could think of was that she’d 
soon be the wife of a big-shot: 
the manager — that is, controls 
setter — of a furniture factory. 

Bozzy had never told her how 
simple the job really was, though 
he supposed she knew. 

You first ordered designs, and 
then you ordered a poll taken on 
the designs. A computer tabu- 
lated the poll’s results and point- 
ed out the design most likely to 
sell. 

You then fed economic data 
into the same computer, and 
found out how many units the 
market could take. You called 
in the engineers to set up the 
machines, and the maintenance 
men to keep them running. In 
brief,' you were errand boy to a 
bunch of gadgets, with nothing to 
do but look important. 

He was practicing his import- 
ant look when Kate bustled in 
and spoiled it by sitting on his 
lap. 

“You’re going to do fine today,” 
she said, “and you’re going to 
get off to a good start. I made 
them show me your cab. It’s one 
of their brand-new battery-elec- 
tric ones, a sort of mauve that 
will go with your purple robe. 
You’ll look swell in it.” 

TIOZZY was kissing her when 
the lobby buzzer sounded 
three long rings. ' 



“There’s your cab,” Kate said, 
rising. 

He followed her to the living 
room. Projected on one wall was 
a picture of the cabman facing 
the lobby annunciator, fifty-three 
stories down. The man was tall, 
fat, and in need of a shave, yet 
he wore purple tights with pink 
and green trim. 

Bozzy shuddered. “Who in the 
world concocted that rig?” 

“Your wife, sir,” the cabman 
answered. 

“It’s beautiful,” said Bozzy. 
“I’ll be right down.” 

He wasn’t, though. Kate told 
the kids he was leaving, and they 
trooped out of the bathroom to 
say good-by. 

Bozzy could tell Ralph was 
the one being bathed only be- 
cause he was naked — all three 
Were equally wet, and equally 
anxious to embrace their Daddy. 
He had to make himself a new 
robe while the cab meter ticked 
and Kate jittered. 

But once started, the drive be- 
tween balconied buildings and in- 
tervening plazas went fast enough, 
Bozzy wasn’t over half "an hour 
late in reaching Mr. Kojac’s 
apartment building. 

The old man waited in the 
street, looking spare, spruce, and 
impatient. 

“I do wish,” he said, easing 
himself into the cab, “that you 
had a less anti-social attitude. 



NEW HIRE 



115 




Now you’ll have to claim I de- 
layed you.” 

“I’m sorry, sir/’ Bozzy mum- 
bled. “It’s kind of you to take 
the blame.” 

He thought it was also typical. 
He had understudied Mr. Kojac 
for the preceding two years, and 
felt there was no one else in the 
world for whom he could have as 
much respect. 

“Actually, sir,” he explained, 
“I was delayed by the children.” 
“An excuse, Boswell! Whether 
conscious or subconscious, noth- 
ing more than an excuse! Distaste 
for today’s ceremonial is smeared 
over your face like so much 
bread-and- jelly.” 

Unconsciously, Bozzy wiped his 
cheeks. 

Mr. Kojac laughed. “You’re 
guilt-ridden and that’s plain ab- 
surd. All young men in your po- 
sition have to go through exactly 
the same thing. You must simply 
make up your mind to do what 
society requires.” 

“All I can think of is your 
kindness,” Bozzy blurted. “People 
should replace those they hate!” 
“But the understudy system 
wouldn’t work, then,” Mr. Kojac 
pointed out. “You can’t learn 
from a man who upsets you.” 
Bozzy nodded miserably. 

TN silence, he let himself be car- 
ried toward the furniture 
factory, till Mr. Kojac asked, 

116 



“Did you bring the stimulants?” 
“Oh, yes, sir. Excuse me. I 
should have offered them sooner.” 
With embarrassed clumsiness, he 
fished from a pocket in his under- 
wear the pills required by custom. 
“Here you are, sir,” he said in 
ritual form. “Big pills make 
troubles little.” 

Mr. Kojac smiled. ‘'I don’t need 
any,” he said gently. “You do. 
Take one.” ^ 

“That isn’t proper!” 

“No one will know. Go ahead.” * 
He would feel like a fool to take 
a pill brought only for Mr. Ko- 
jac’s use. He would feel much 
more like a fool if he broke down 
during the ceremony — might even 
lose his job. 

He took the pill, finally, and 
immediately felt sorry. He was 
still tense and twitchy when they 
reached the factory. 

As custom demanded, every- 
one was out of sight. Nobody met 
them at the gate, or observed 
their silent progress up the esca- 
lator to the personnel office. 
Noiselessly; through empty 
soundproof offices, they walked 
together to the ceremonial cham- 
ber. 

The door they used was the 
room’s only entrance. It was 
hooked open invitingly. Within 
was a small conference table of 
imitation oak, and six chairs of 
imitation leather. Ceiling, walls, 
and floor were plastic sheets in 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




soft, sandy shades that harmon- 
ized with the furniture's rich 
browns. » 

On the table were four wrist- 
lets, four anklets, and two belts, 
all njade of iron links and stamp- 
ed with either Bozzy’s or Mr. 
Kojac’s name. As he had been 
told to do, Bozzy picked out and 
put on his own set while Mr. Ko- 
jac rested in the armchair at the 
head of the table. Then, breath- 
ing noisily, he knelt before Mr. 
Kojac and fastened the old man’s 
anklets. 

He rose, grunting. Mr. Kojac 
held out first the left hand, then 
the right, while Bozzy put the 
wristlets on him. Their cheeks 
accidently touched while Bozzy 
fastened the belt. He thought of 
his father and was irrationally 
tempted to plant a kiss, as if he 
were four instead of forty. 

He stifled the impulse and 
shook hands instead. 

“Good luck,” Mr. Kojac said. 

HPHE procedure did not call for 
that remark, and so, for a 
second, Bozzy forgot what came 
next. Then, helped by the stimu- 
lant pill, he focused his thoughts, 
crossed the room, and turned a 
lighted red switch that glowed by 
the door. 

He heard a muffled clank as 
iron links froze to the magnetized 
armchair, sounding the signal for 
his speech. 



“Sir,” he intoned, “the Com- 
pany takes this opportunity to 
express its deep and heart-felt 
appreciation of the thirty-five 
years you have devoted to serv- 
ing the Company, the furniture 
industry generally, and that great 
public, our customers.” 

Without looking at Mr. Ko- 
jac, he bowed, turned, went out, 
and released the catch holding 
the door open. It closed automat- 
ically, and automatically set in 
motion the rest of the ceremony. 

From somewhere out of sight, 
fat Mr. Frewne waddled over arid 
briefly shook Bozzy’s hand 

“You’ve done fine,” he wheezed. 
“A little late getting started, but 
that’s to be expected. Every- 
thing’s fine — just fine!” 

Praise seemed a miscue, Boz- 
zy didn’t quite know how to an- 
swer, 

“Sir,” he asked, mopping his 
forehead, “what about Mr. Ko- 
jac?” 

“Oh, he’s all right,” Mr. 
Frewne said. “Those fumes are 
fast. We can leave the rest to the 
undertaker.” 

He slapped Bozzy on the back 
and pushed him down the corri- 
dor. “Come on into my office, 
boy. I’ll pour you a drink — pour 
us each one, as a matter of fact. 
And hand over your iron jewelry, 
son. You won’t need that stuff 
again for thirty-five years.”

CHILDREN OF WONDER, 
edited by William Term. Simon 
& Schuster, Inc., New York, 1953. 
336 pages, $2.95 

Yl^HIS is a practically perfect 
anthology: a carefully thought 
out, lovingly planned and charm- 
ingly presented patchwork of 
fantasies about the strangenesses 
of children. 

As Mr. Tenn points out in his 
delightful introduction, the juxta- 



position of literary lights such as 
D. H. Lawrence (“Rocking Horse 
Winner”), E. M. Forster (“Story 
of a Panic”), and A. E. Coppard 
(“Adam and Eve and Pinch 
Me”), among others, with science 
fiction writers like Theodore 
Sturgeon (“Baby Is Three”), 
Murray Leinster (“Keyhole”), 
Katherine MacLean (“The Origin 
of the Species,” a magnificently 
uncomfortable tale never before 
published anywhere) and others

of equal note, shows that — almost 
unbeknownst to the pundits of 
the literary reviews — some of our 
good science fiction writers are 
turning out literature, too. 

Tenn has had the temerarious 
good taste to include his own 
“Errand Boy” in the book — just 
right, too, particularly since it 
separates two of the more omi- 
nous entries, a section from Hux- 
ley’s “Brave New World” that 
tells about the human baby 
hatchery, and Stephen Vincent 
Benet’s verbose but effective nar- 
rative poem, “Nightmare for 
Future Reference.” 

In addition to those men- 
tioned, the following also have 
fine tales in this collection: C. M. 
Kornbluth, Ray Bradbury, Tru- 
man Capote, Mary-Alice Schir- 
ring, “Saki,” Grahame Greene, 
Jane Rice, Poul Anderson, Lewis 
Padgett, Judith Merril, Richard 
Matheson and Wilmar H. Shiras, 
the last four with stories well 
known to science fiction anthol- 
ogy readers. 

THE DEMOLISHED MAN by 
Alfred Bester. Shasta Publishers, 
Inc., Chicago, 1953. 250 pages, $3 

A LOT of toothless talk going 
the rounds declares queru- 
lously that what science fiction 
needs is more maturity. It’s still 
for babes, it’s too much space 
opera, etc. 



True enough that there is a 
lot of cheap and bad stuff being 
written, but there is also The 
Demolished Man, and a few oth- 
ers nearly in its class. (Incident- 
ally, the novel was originally a 
GALAXY serial, as were many 
of the recent crop of high-grade 
books.) 

Among other things,, this is as 
fascinating a study of character 
as I have ever read. Ben Reich, 
owner of the second most power- 
ful business monopoly in the 
Solar System, ruthless murderer 
and bitterly tortured soul, is an 
unforgettably Vivid personality. 

The book is also a brilliant 
picture of society in the year 
2301, a society in which every 
profession and trade has its 
quota of mind-reading telepaths, 
most trusted (and hated) of all 
public servants. From Maria 
Beaumont’s imitation Pennsyl- 
vania Terminal mansion, express- 
ing almost immeasurable luxury, 
to Chooka Frood’s Rainbow 
House, scene of the lowest vices 
and most brutal crimes, one is 
given a violently real view of a 
society in which the neuroses of 
20th Century urbanism have 
been almost infinitely multiplied 
through extrapolation. 

But the strongest attraction of 
the book is its plot. It is 'actually 
a superb murder-detective story 
in which the murderer (Ben 
Reich) is known practically from

the start, but in which the mo- 
tive was completely misunder- 
stood, thus making conviction 
erf the murderer almost impos- 
sible. For he did not really know 
his own motives — and until those 
motives were clear, Reich could 
not be convicted and sent to 
Demolition; the police’s Think- 
ing Machine would reject the 
evidence and, under Tomorrow’s 
law, that would permit the mur- 
derer to go free. 

How he is finally trapped into 
a final recognition of his own 
basic motives is truly great psy- 
chological surrealism. 

In an otherwise laudable and 
lauding review, H. H. Holmes 
labels such ingenuities as @tkins 
for Atkins and Wygfls for Wygand 
as “coy whimsies.” w on you, Mr. 
Holmes, for ignoring language 
development! Many symbols 
need only formal inclusion tq 
make them part of the alphabet; 
in actual practice, they are there 
already. 

But your pedantry is forgiven, 
for you recognize this as a mag- 
nificent novel, which it decidedly 
is.

DESIGN FOR A BRAIN by W. 
Ross Ashby, M.D. John Wiley 8s

pages, $6.00 

¥ HAVE not dared to attempt 
a review of this epochal book 
until I could enlist authoritative 
support from scientific reviews 
for my belief that it is an amaz- 
ing step forward in the science 
and philosophy of the human 
brain. 

Warren S. McCulloch, M.D., 
in a lead review in The Scientific 
American, writes that Ashby, a 
British psychiatrist and neurolo- 
gist, has “laid the foundation for 
a mechanistic theory of how bio- 
logical systems adapt which for 
many years to come will com- 
mand the respect and guide the 
imagination of his most formid- 
able critics ...”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




And, believe me, they will be 
formidable, since the author thor- 
oughly demolishes the old meta- 
physical dichotomy between body 
and soul, mind and brain, and 
thus arrays against himself the 
whole world of religion and mys- 
ticism. 

The book is not easy to read, 
even though the mathematical 
theory is tucked away in an Ap- 
pendix. But, though difficult, its 
message is so exciting that any- 
one interested in the theories of 
cybernetics and advanced psy- 
chology, as well as in the more 
philosophical problems men- 
tioned, will want to struggle 
through the text for its new con- 
cepts and illuminating insights. 

The conclusion is that, by de- 
veloping “ultrastable” types of 
machines and by combining and 
refining them, it should be pos- 
sible (in Dr. McCulloch’s words) 
to produce “a multistable sys- 
tem whose adaptations to the 
vicissitudes of life have no upper 
limit except those of our imagi- 
nation.” 

In other words, a better-than- 
human brain. 

HELLFLOWER by George O. 
Smith. Abelard Press, New York, 
1953. 264 pages, $2.75 

OPACE operas are usually 
^ pretty unsatisfactory for adult 
readers, but George O. Smith has 

★ * * * * SHELF 



now written a grown-up, exciting, 
well-worked-out space opus that 
deserves the ultimate commenda- 
tion of wide reading. By calling 
it a “space opus,” I mean to 
classify it as straight adventure 
as against more complex and 
sociologically slanted space docu- 
ments like Asimov’s Foundation 
series, not to run it down as an 
empty potboiler. It isn’t by any 
means. 

The story revolves around the 
efforts of Farradyne, an ex-space- 
bum rescued from the depths by 
the Solar Anti-narcotics Depart- 
ment, to break up the love 1 ms, 
or “hellflower,” racket. There are 
fantastic space flights, hand-to- 
hand combats, dodges and es- 
capes; there is some remarkably 
adult and actually quite moving 
lovemaking and sex psychology; 
and, when you think back over 
the story, there is one of the most 
effectively integrated plots in re- 
cent science fiction. 

It would be unfair to the reader 
to tell more than this; the payoff 
is too revealing a giveaway. Let 
it stand that “Hellflower,” with 
the exception of some rather 
hasty tying up of loose ends as 
the story closes, is a fine and 
extremely enjoyable job. 

THE ROBOT AND THE MAN, 
edited by Martin Greenberg. 
Gnome Press, New York, 1953, 
251 pages, $2.95 



123 




ITiEN stories, several of them 
longish novelets, and eight of 
them B or better. This is a good 
average, better than most an- 
thologies. There are two stories 
by Lester del Rey and one each 
by John D. MacDonald, Bernard 
Wolfe (best story in the book 
and the original from which some 
of the fantastic ideas in his novel 
Limbo — see GALAXY for May 
1953 — were taken), Lewis Pad- 
gett, H. H. (Tony Boucher) 
Holmes, John S. Browning (not 
too good), A. E. van Vogt (ditto), 
Joseph E. Kelleam (fine) and 
Robert Moore Williams. All on 
robots, and none heretofore an- 
thologized. 

I would like to make a small 
criticism of the book’s planning, 
hoping Mr. Greenberg will not 
think it amiss : the chronolog- 
ical development of robots as 
seen by different writers develops 
some uncomfortably obvious con- 
tradictions. In one story, the 
Earth has been completely deci- 
mated and only robots are left. 
In the next, there are people 
aplenty. The result is confusing, 
to say the least. 

I suspect that this problem 
should lead to a generality on 
“idea” anthologies: one should 
never try to tell a connected story 
in such a book. One should, 
rather, present a variety of alter- 
nates, so that none conflict with 
its neighbors and all add to a 



rich pattern of different possibili- 
ties for the future. 

SPACE PLATFORM by Mur- 
ray Leinster. Pocket Books, Inc., 
New York, 1953. 167 pages, 25( 

TT is unfortunate that this melo- 
* drama for teen-agers, origi- 
nally planned for hard-cover pub- 
lication by Shasta Publishers, but 
not yet issued by them, bears no 
indication on its reprint cover 
that it is designed for young peo- 
ple. You start off expecting the 
usual rich Leinster job, and 
abruptly find yourself with a 
pared-down, oversimplified boy’s 
book, perfect for its special mar- 
ket, but hardly for grownups. 

The story tells how young Joe 
Kenmore, with the aid of various 
cohorts including young Sally 
Holt (romance) and her stern 
pa, Major Holt (drama), suc- 
ceeds in helping to foil ten or a 
dozen assorted attempts to sabo- 
tage the United States’ fixed-orbit 
space station as it is being built 
in an American desert. Nobody 
but the U.S.A. wants the station, 
since it will put the rest of the 
world under our domination. Of 
course Joe and the U.S.A. win, 
the spade station flies up to its 
orbit, and everything is hunky- 
dory. 

This is a good thriller indeed — 
for youngsters.'

broke loose and cantered across 
the outfield with its peculiar five- 
legged gait. In the hubbub, Ray 
Bush stole second. Nobody seem- 
ed to notice. 

Sighing heavily, Bill returned 
to the mound and whiplashed in 
a fast one, tight across the letters. 
The hitter got only a small piece 
of it; a pop fly sauntered toward 
left field. Judging it to a nicety, 
Gust Mustas came racing in, 
evaded a tethered thrag, leaped 
a hole some Quxa had dug and 
forgotten, and made a shoestring 
catch, retiring the side. The 
Quxas cheered deliriously. 

Bill trotted off the mound. For 
a moment, the thrill of the game 
held him. This was the way 
things should be: The feel of 
* smoothly flowing muscles, the 
thudding sound of horsehide hit- 
ting a leather glove, the weight of 
a bat in your hands in your first 
ball game after clambering over 
and scrabbling in an unexplored 
planet for fourteen months. 

Then he caught sight of Can- 
dace Mathews, walking among 
the pneuma-huts that served as 
the outpost camp for the expedi- 
tion. Gloom enveloped him again, 
surrounding him like a dank fog. 

TT'OR fourteen long months, Bill 
had feasted on the memory of 
Candy Mathews, on his recollec- 
tion of her torquoise eyes and 
cascading brown hair, on the re- 



membrance of her soft lips on his 
last night under the four moons 
of Vensor III. 

Today she had arrived with 
the seventy-odd men and women 
who comprised the appraisal unit, 
the final group of the planet’s ex- 
plorers. He had looked forward 
like a schoolboy to her coming. 
And, like a schoolboy, he had 
suffered black despair when his 
dreams were shattered. 

For the Candy Mathews who 
got off the shuttlebug at Camp 
Outpost was not the Candy 
Mathews who had said soft 
words on Vensor III. She was, 
instead, a self-assured young wo- 
man, somehow harder, who felt 
only an indifferent tolerance to- 
ward a tall young man named 
Bill Bradley, and an all-consum- 
ing, hero-worshiping infatuation 
for a newcomer, a dapper walking 
brain, Vance Montgomery, one 
of the council’s smart boys, with 
the title of planet evaluator. 

“He’s simply wonderful,” she 
had said. And the joy of life had 
gone out of Bill Bradley. 

The appraisal group brought 
in athletic equipment and Bill’s 
men spontaneously declared a 
holiday, their first on the planet. 
Baseball was the order of the 
afternoon and they shanghaied a 
not unwilling Bill to pitch. He 
should, he knew, be laying out 
reports for Montgomery to study. 
He did not particularly want to 



HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



127 




be with Montgomery. 

Bill sat on the xetal log that 
served as a bench. 

One Quxa was bent over, ex- 
amining first base. He made a 
colorful sight. The first baseman 
slapped him jovially on the loin 
cloth to move him. 

The owner of the thrag caught 
up to it and was struggling man- 
fully to lead it away. The five- 
legged beast defied his efforts, 
rearing and dragging him. A doz- 
en Quxas stood nearby. Their 
sympathies were obviously with 
their fellow-Quxa, but they made 
no move to help him. 

Reed was on the bench next to 
Bill. He had come in with the 
appraisal group. 

“Your vivid friends,” he said, 
cocking a thumb at the Quxas, 
“don’t appear too bright.” 

“They’re smart enough,” said 
Bill. “Almost as intelligent as we 
are. It’s just that they’ve never 
risen above a herd culture.” 

“Look,” said Reed. “I’m a sil- 
viculturist. Give me a hunk of 
wood and I can tell how long it 
took to grow, what it’s good for, 
where it can be raised and how 
much board and profit can be 
made out of it. But this kind of 
talk throws me. Try another 
wave-length.” 

“Socially, they’re like the seals 
or penguins back on Earth. They 
like to gather in groups. The 
things they can do individually, 



they do well. But they don’t 
know how to help each other. 
That’s beyond them.” 

“Don’t understand the mean- 
ing of cooperation?” 

“The word isn’t even in their 
language. I’ve seen forty of them 
standing around, fretting and 
stewing, while the horals killed 
off one of their fellows.” 

“What are horals?” 

“The other dominant life-form 
here. Nasty brutes, like big up- 
right ants with tentacles. Stand 
about as high as my chest. Most 
malignant things I’ve seen. One 
Quxa can handle any horal, may- 
be even two or three. But the 
horals hunt in packs. Good-by 
Quxa.” 

“Killing them off, are they?” 
“This is the last big concentra- 
tion the Quxas have left. In an- 
other hundred years, there’ll be 
no more Quxas.” 

npHEY looked again at the na- 
tives. The Quxas were some- 
thing to see — human in form, al- 
though somewhat shorter than 
Earthmen; their skins were 
blotched and dashed with patches 
of vivid colors. Antiquarians 
talked of their resemblance to 
the ancient circus clowns, a like- 
ness furthered by their broad, flat 
faces and habitual grins. 

“Sort of hate to see them 
disappear,” Bill said glumly. 
“They’re happy, good-natured 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




creatures. In their whole race, I 
know only one who’s mean. We’ve 
done our best to help them. But 
if they won’t cooperate even in 
a matter of life and death, what 
incentive can you offer them?” 

An elbow dug into him. 

“Up to the platter, dream boy,” 
said Gust Mustas. “A hit means 
two runs.” 

Selecting a bat. Bill made his 
way to the plate. In the middle 
distance, Vance Montgomery 
emerged from a hut. Candy went 
to him eagerly, put a hand on 
his arm. A deep rage engulfed 
Bill. 

The first pitch was a curve that 
failed to break. As it came fatly 
over the plate, Bill swung angri- 
ly. The ball rocketed up and 
away, past the infield, over the 
head of the desperately running 
left-fielder and dropped toward 
a sure home run. 

Then a curious thing happen- 
ed. One of the Quxas darted away 
from the gabbling group along 
the foul line, his short legs churn- 
ing over the uneven ground. As 
the ball sank, he dove, plucked it 
out of the air with one broad 
hand, turned a somersault and 
came up with it, grinning. It was 
an impossible catch and the 
Earthmen joined the Quxas in 
applause. Still clinging to the 
ball, the Quxa made little bob- 
bing bows of acknowledgment. 

“Throw it in!” shouted Bill. 

HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 




The Quxa stood motionless. 
“Throw it in, Adlaa!” Bill urged. 
He went through a throwing mo- 
tion. 

The Quxa nodded comprehen- 
sion. He went into a violent wind- 
up. His left foot came up, his 
upper body went back, his right 
arm snapped in an arc. The ball 
flew from his hand, straight and 
fast. 

In the wrong direction, of 
course. 

The pack of Quxas pelted after 
it, shouting, picked it up and 
threw again. To his surprise. Bill 
found himself pounding after 
them, bawling fruitless pleas, 
aware that he looked foolish, but, 
in his rage, not caring. He closed- 
in on them on the fifth throw and 
his fingertips touched the ball. He 
succeeded only in deflecting it. 
There was a dull thunk and the 
game was over. The ball had 
struck Vance Montgomery, plan- 
et evaluator, squarely in the left 
eye. 

Three things were said then to 
Bill Bradley. 

One was by Montgomery as he 
handed back the ball. “I was not 
aware, Bradley, that the job of 
camp leader entailed joining the 
rowdyism of the native races.” 

One was by Candy Mathews, 
hopping with anger. “You’re a 
barbarian, Bill Bradley. Monty 
might have been badly hurt.” 

The third was by a clot of 



Quxas, crowding eagerly. “Play 
ball! Billbrad, more play ball!” 
To the first two, Bill did not 
reply. To the Quxas, he said one 
word, “Nuts!” and dolefully fol- 
lowed Montgomery into the head- 
quarters hut. 

I N spite of his natural prejudice 
against Montgomery, Bill v;qs 
forced into a reluctant admiration 
for the way the man worked. 

Montgomery’s task was to rec- 
ommend whether the planet 
should be marked for immediate 
colonization, placed on a reserve 
list for future expansion, or be 
left strictly alone as unworthy of 
occupancy. He tore through Bill’s 
reports like a small child through 
a bag of jellybeans. His ques- 
tions, if pompous, were pointed. 

Within twenty -four hours, 
ready to leave for the main camp, 
he called a conference. 

He stood before the group, as 
dapper as a man can be with a 
rainbow bruise under one eye, 
complacently listening to the res- 
onance of his own voice. Beside 
him, Candy nodded worshipful 
agreement. Bill grumped in a 
corner. 

For a full forty-five minutes, 
Montgomery outlined additional 
data he wanted gathered. His 
voice was faintly chiding, imply- 
ing by its tone that anybody but 
a dolt would have obtained the 
information long ago. 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“And now,” he said, “we come 
to the question of the humanoid 
denizens of this planet — the so- 
called Quxas.” He fingered his 
black eye. “Many persons might 
conclude that the Quxas are not 
worth saving; and in themselves, 
they are not. However, my pre- 
liminary conclusions — based, un- 
fortunately, on insufficient data 
— lead me to believe that this 
planet will be used for coloniza- 
tion in about five hundred years. 
It would be very convenient then 
to have a dominant life-form 
friendly to the galactic humans 
and capable of being integrated 
with the colonists. Some method 
of preserving the Quxas must 
therefore be worked out. In this, 
the advance group has failed la- 
mentably.” 

He paused, glanced around tri- 
umphantly. 

“How do I propose to achieve 
this? By a historical method. 
What do nations do when they 
are in peril? They call upon a 
single man, place themselves 
under him and let him lead them 
out. When the ancient western 
civilization was in its greatest 
danger after the fall of Rome, the 
people gathered around the strong 
men, made them kings and dukes 
and earls, and were saved from 
barbarism. 

“I shall do the same for the 
Quxas. The Quxas shall have a 
king.” 



His eyes sought out Bill. 

“My acquaintance here has 
been short. I must rely on advice. 
Bradley, whom would you recom- 
mend as king of the Quxas?” 

“Well,” said Bill slowly, 
“Moahlo is the most intelligent. 
He’s good-natured and kindly. 
He has a lot of artistic ability. N 
Some of his carvings are being 
taken back for the Galactic Folk 
Museum.” 

“An artist!” said Montgomery 
in disgust. “Well, let’s have a 
look at him.” 

"!%/!' O AHL.O was finishing a figu- 
rine near one of the mean- 
dering paths that the Quxas had 
worn by habit, not design. A be- 
mused group of natives looked 
on admiringly. 

Down the path came Ratakka, 
the biggest of the Quxas, his 
shoulders proudly back, his face 
set in the truculent scowl. Bill 
knew and disliked him, and ap- 
prehensively felt sure the peace- 
ful scene would be destroyed. 
Alone of an amiable, tolerant 
race, Ratakka was perpetually 
ill-tempered, the rankling prod- 
uct of Lord knew what alien 
genetic accident or trauma. 

Ratakka found his path ob- 
structed by the carving. Callous- 
ly, he brought his foot down on 
the delicate figurine, crushing it 
to splinters. Moahlo sprang up in 
gentle protest. Ratakka gave him 



HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



131 




the back of a meaty hand that 
knocked him off his feet. Two 
spectators indicated disapproval. 
Ratakka smashed their heads to- 
gether and strode on. 

“To save a culture, Bradley,” 
said Montgomery, who had 
watched the brutal display with 
admiration, “you need strength, 
not delicacy or feeling. That man 
shall be king of the Quxas.” 

He ran after Ratakka. 

The members of the outpost 
staff looked at Bill in dismay. 
He shrugged sadly and walked 
out of the headquarters hut. At 
the doorway, Adlaa was waiting 
for him with' the same old plea. 

“Play ball?” he begged. “More 
play ball, Billbrad?” 

In his despondent mood, Bill 
did not care. 

“All right. I’ll throw the ball 
to you and you throw it back to 
me.” 

“Quxas not do that.” 

“It’s just as much fun to throw 
the ball in one direction as in any 
other direction,” Bill explained 
patiently. “Unless you throw it 
back, forget it — no play ball.” 
Adlaa thought seriously. “Hun- 
ky dokey. Want play ball.” 
They were tossing it back and 
forth in the middle of a cheering 
group when a half-track passed, 
taking Montgomery, Candy and 
Ratakka to the main camp. The 
look that the girl gave Bill was 
disdainful. 



“There’s a gaggle of natives 
outside in assorted shades,” said 
Pat Reed the next day. “They 
want to play ball. Moahlo’s at 
their head. He carved a bat.” 
“Tell them to beat it. We’re 
busy.” 

“Let’s give them some fun 
while we can. They won’t enjoy 
life much after King Rat gets 
back here.” 

“That’s the truth,” Bill agreed. 
“All right.” 

“T WISH your painted idiots 
would get over their base- 
ball mania,” complained Rudy 
Peters, the mineralogist, two days 
later. “Look me over carefully, 
will you, Bill? I think my throw- 
ing arm just dropped off.” 

“They’re nutty about it, all 
right,” Bill Bradley said. “Too 
bad it couldn’t have been about 
something with some economic 
value.” 

“Economic value, the man 
wants. Okay, I’ll talk economic 
value to you. Bet you fifty units 
I can make a better ball team out 
of these freaks than you can.” 
“Well, make it thirty.” 
“You’re on, sucker. I’ve lined 
up the sweetest shortstop that 
ever spit in a glove ...” 

“Here’s your thirty,” said Rudy 
Peters a week after. “How was I 
to know that shortstop wouldn’t 
throw the ball to anyone except 
the center -fielder?” 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Team play’s the stuff, lad,” 
said Bill Bradley. “Stress team 
play. Twenty-five, twenty-seven, 
twenty-nine, thirty. Exactly 
right. Another lesson at the same 
price?” 

He was refused, but never on 
an exploration had Bill Bradley 
had so much fun. And never, he 
reminded himself grimly, had he 
got so little work done. The 
Quxas were neglecting their 
skimpy food plots in their eager- 
ness to play. They were getting 
lean. Finally, with reluctance, 
Bill called a temporary halt to 
baseball. 

“Billbrad say no baseball until 
work done,” said Moahlo sadly 
to Adlaa. “Sometimes Billbrad 
talk like southpaw pitcher.” 

Adlaa was trying to cultivate 
his food plot with the help of a 
thrag. The beast was of inde- 
pendent mind. It dragged Adlaa 
in eccentric ovals, in defiance of 
agricultural needs. 

“Adlaa want finish work, play 
baseball,” the Quxa commented. 
“Thrag no play baseball, say nuts 
to work. Adlaa be old like Old 
Hoss Radbourne before work 
done.” 

Moahlo contemplated. “Adlaa 
have trouble his thrag. Moahlo 
have trouble his. Moahlo help 
Adlaa his thrag and Adlaa help 
Moahlo his. Get work done more 
faster.” 

Adlaa dismissed the revolu- 

HALF P*AST ALLIGATOR 



tionary thought. “Quxas not do.” 
“We play baseball run down 
play,” argued Moahlo. “Play to- 
gether. You throw ball me. I 
throw ball you. Yippee. Man 
out.” 

“Same team. Old pals. Want 
sing team song?” 

“Want play team with thrag.” 
Adlaa considered the matter in 
this new light. “Like ball game,” 
he said at last in amazement. 

“Sure. You, me be us together. 
Make thrag look like busher.” 
They both took hold of the 
thrag. Unable to resist their com- 
bined strengths, the beast sub- 
mitted docilely. They began to 
work. 

G LANCING out from his labor 
in the headquarters pneuma- 
hut, Bill saw the incident in hap- 
py surprise. Perhaps, after all, 
his stay here might produce 
something to help the culture 
that Montgomery would intro- 
duce upon his return. He had no 
doubt of Montgomery’s success. 

Neither, for that matter, had 
Montgomery. At the main camp, 
things were going swimmingly. 

The camp lay on the very 
fringe of the Quxa territory, but, 
by an arduous hunt, Ratakka had 
captured eight wandering Quxas 
to whom he immediately set 
about teaching the dyties of sub- 
jects. His method was simple — 
the Quxa followed his orders, 



133 




which he obtained from Mont- 
gomery, or the Quxa was knocked 
down, If he still refused, he was 
knocked down again. Within 
three weeks, Ratakka had them 
doing things no Quxas ever had 
done before. They performed 
them reluctantly and sullenly, 
but they did them. 

Seeing the result, but not the 
means, Candy was enthusiastic. 

“They’re working together!” 
she cried. “Oh, Monty, what will 
the Quxas do to reward you?” 
“Oh, they’ll probably make a 
culture god of me,” said Mont- 
gomery, managing to look mod- 
est. “Like the Greeks did to that 
Martian, Proma Ss Thaa', who 
taught them the use of fire.” 

As time went on, though, the 
girl began to have doubts. 

“But they’re doing everything 
for Ratakka,” she protested. “As 
far as they’re concerned them- 
selves, they’re more wretched 
than before.” 

“That’s the way feudal cul- 
tures are built, my dear,” Mont- 
gomery assured her. “The king 
gives them law and a fighting 
leader. In return, the subjects 
take care of his bodily comfort.” 
“But they look so unhappy!” 
“In saving an inferior race, we 
cannot be concerned too much 
about the happiness of a few 
miserable members. Perhaps in 
three hundred years or so, they 
can afford happiness.” 



And finally an incident hap- 
pened to complete her disillu- 
sionment. 

One of Ratakka’s morose sub- 
jects managed to slip the shac- 
kles with which he was bound at 
night and make a bolt for free- 
dom. The king pursued him re- 
lentlessly, brought him back and 
then beat him, coldly and cruelly, 
slugging and gouging and kick- 
ing. 

Ashen-faced, Candy moved to 
interfere; Montgomery restrained 
her. 

“We’re saving a race,” he said. 
“You can’t make an omelet with- 
out breaking a few eggs.” 

Candy turned and ran sobbing 
to her quarters, unable to dispel 
the memory of the writhing body 
on the ground. 

nPHE next day was the day to 
■*- move equipment. It was a 
policy of the expeditions to leave 
their wornout machines for the 
most friendly of the native races, 
who could dismantle them and 
use the parts. The equipment not 
worth toting back to Earth was 
to be taken to the advance camp, 
where the Quxa center was. 
Montgomery also planned that 
day to take Ratakka to his king- 
dom. 

A few minutes ahead of the 
motorcade, Candy slipped out, 
got into a battered half-track 
and started driving the eighty 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE flCTION 




miles to the advance camp. For 
the first twenty-five miles, she 
told herself that her eagerness 
was because it was a nice day 
and she wanted to get out of 
camp. 

For the next twenty-five miles, 
she called herself a liar. 

For the third twenty-five miles 
she gave herself up unashamedly 
to thinking about Bill Bradley: 
his smile, his gentleness, the awk- 
ward grace of his lean body. Not 
a man to set a planet on fire -but 
how pleasant and restful to have 
around! 

She wondered if he would for- 
give the way she had acted. Some- 
how she was sure he would. 

The narrow vehicular trail ran 
through a grove of fernlike trees. 
It’s just over the rise, Candy 
thought, just over the rise and 
down into the saucer, where Bill 
is waiting ... 

The half-track struck a rock, 
lurched, threw a tread and went 
off the road, out of control. 

That did not matter especially, 
for the Quxas could use the ma- 
terial very well where it was. 
Candy went forward briskly 
afoot. A fallen branch brushed 
her ankle. Unheedingly, she kick- 
ed it away. She began to recon- 
struct Bill, feature by feature: 
the way his hair swirled on his 
forehead; his eyebrows, arched 
and regular; his eyes, wide, deep- 
seated, with inner pools of mer- 

HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



riment; his nose, straight and 
rather . 

Another branch caught her. 
She lifted her foot to free it. It 
did not come free. Another ten- 
tacle moved around her, pinion- 
ing her right arm to her side. She 
whirled in terror and found her- 
self in the grip of the horals. 

TTPHERE were a dozen of the 
horrors, their antenna ears 
erect, mandibles open. They ex- 
uded an acid odor, a sign of hun- 
ger. Candy screamed. She fought 
to reach her pistol, strapped to 
her right hip. More tentacles 
stopped her. She screamed and 
screamed again, throwing her 
body to shake off the grip, trying 
to kick with her feet. 

There was a movement in the 
road at the top of the rise. For a 
moment, elation surged in Candy, 
almost stifling her. Perhaps some 
expedition member had heard 
her, was hurrying to her rescue. 
Then she saw that the newcomers 
were Quxas. Hope vanished, leav- 
ing her limp and hollow. To be 
killed by these horrors was bad 
enough, but to be killed in the 
presence of a group of piebald 
morons, who would stand and 
watch and moan, but not lift a 
hand . 

In her agitation, she did not 
notice that the Quxas were nine 
.in number and wore baseball 
caps. They drew short clubs, 



135 




shaped like bats. 

“Kill the umpire!” they shout- 
ed, hatred born of diamond con- 
flicts in their cry. “Kill the um- 
pire!” they yelled and charged. 

¥N military formation, they 
-*• clubbed their way through 
their enemies, battering and 
smashing until Candy was free, 
with a dozen dying horals on the 
ground, their tentacles contract- ' 
ing and writhing. The Quxa 
leader made his bobbing bow to 
her. 1 

“How do,” he said politely. 
“We dip them in calcimine vat, 
you bet. We hang them out like 
wash. Now we give team yell.” 
The Quxas put their arms 
around each other’s shoulders. 
In unison, they chanted: 

“Hoe tomata; hoe potata 
Half past alligata, 

Bum, bum, bulligata, 
Chickala dah! 

Pussycats! Pussycats! 

Rah! Rah! Rah!” 

“Pussycats,” the' leader ex- 
plained to Candy, “are honored 
animal on planet where Billbrad 
is head cheese.” 

“I’ll bet you play baseball 
nicely,” Candy said. 

Woe broke forth on nine broad 
faces. 

“Misfortunately not,” confess- 
ed the captain^ “Thirty-three 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




teams in Quxa town. Pussycats 
in thirty-third place.” He bright- 
ened. “Go ivory hunt now. Catch 
nine new Quxas. Teach ’em base- 
ball. Then maybe we beat ’em 
and not be in cellar any more.” 

Together, the team bobbed po- 
litely to Candy and trotted down 
the road. 

Happily,. Candy went up the 
rise, then stopped in astonish- 
ment, looking at Quxa town. 

Gone was the straggling, hap- 
hazard settlement, with the flimsy 
huts and untended starvation 
patches where individual Quxas 
tried to raise their own food. In- 
stead, building sites were laid 
out in straight, broad rows, and 
Quxas were working, three and 
four in a group, raising substan- 
tial homes of timber. Others were 
surrounding the settlement with 
a wall of brambles, impenetrable 
to horals. Teams of men, two to 
a thrag, were plowing, preparing 
large fields for tillage. And down 
the side of the settlement, affec- 
tionately tended, ran a line of 
baseball fields. 

Just off the road, a Quxa squat- 
ted, baseball cap on his head, 
watching a crude sun dial. 

“Nice day for game,” he greet- 
ed Candy. 

^JPEECHLESS with surprise, 
the girl made a dazed ques- 
tioning gesture toward the im- 
provements. 



“Billbrad do it,” the Quxa in- 
formed her. “He tell us how. 
Work one by one, he say, work 
all time to fill belly, maybe fill 
horal belly instead. Work all by 
all, do more quick- Have time 
in afternoon. Batter up! Sock it, 
boy! Wing it home, he sliding!” 

The sun’s shadow touched a 
peg. 

“Five minute!” bawled the 
Quxa. 

The laborers quit work, put 
away their tools. The farmers 
herded their thrags into a strong- 
ly constructed corral. The natives 
gathered in knots at the settle- 
ment edge and looked longingly 
at the baseball fields. 

“Yestday I fool Billbrad,” con- 
fided the Quxa. “I hide ball, 
catch him off second. Billbrad get 
all red face and say — ” 

“Never mind what Bill said,” 
Candy interjected hastily. 

The shadow touched another 
peg. 

“Play ball!” the Quxa yelled. 
“Play ball! Play ball! Play ball!” 

He sprang up, produced a base- 
ball glove and spat into it rev- 
erently. 

“I go play now. You come see. 
Get scorecard, know players.” 

He looked at Candy hopefully. 

“ ’Specially me,” he added. 

Out of the moil of Quxas came 
the lank form of Bill Bradley. He 
spied the girl, whooped and came 
running to her. For a few mo-

merits they talked at once, in an 
incoherent and ecstatic jumble. 
Then Candy, catching control of 
herself, cited in admiration the 
change in the Quxa village. 

“And you’ve done all this!” she 
concluded. 

“I didn’t do anything!” Bill 
protested. “They like to play 
baseball and this sort of happen- 
ed. We’re getting representative 
government into action now. Each 
team elects a captain and the 
captains are the town council. 
Tonight they’re going to vote on 
naming the settlement Brooklyn.” 

“You know,” said Candy, “I’ll 
bet they’ll make you a culture 
god.” 

'X’HE tanned face of Bill Brad- 
ley took on the rose hue of a 
blush. 

“Well, Moahlo carved a statue 
and they’ve put it in front of 
league headquarters — that’s their 
city hall,” he admitted uncom- 
fortably. “It doesn’t look much 
like me. I’ve got six arms because 
they wanted me batting, pitching 
and catching a ball all at the 
same time.” 

Candy slipped a hand into his. 

“Is there a place around here,” 
she asked in a small tone, “where 
a culture god can take a girl and 
— well, talk to her?” 

“Is there!” said Bill. “You just 
come with me . .” 

A heavy object bumped into 



him. He whirled at the touch. | 
“Oh! Hi, Ratakka,” Bill said I 
in a flat voice. | 

Montgomery’s king had return- ; 
ed to his subjects. He was alone ' 
— his captives having escaped on i 
the ride over — and he was in vile | 
temper. Glaring evilly, he mo- 
tioned at the baseball players. 
He was recalling an advice of 
Montgomery: “Whatever your j 

subjects like to do most, do it j 
better than they can. In that 
way, you will get their respect 
and find it easier to take over.” 
“What that fool doings-on?” 
snarled Ratakka. “Ratakka do, 
too.” 

Bill’s already sagging spirits 
sank again. With Ratakka’s 
strength and reflexes, the great 
brute undoubtedly would become 
the star of stars, gathering ad- 
mirers to himself and destroying 
all the pleasant prospects now so 
happily started. Still, it was Bill’s 
duty to give him every chance . 

“I’ll see what team has an 
opening, Ratakka. Perhaps you’d 
better bat seventh for a few days. 
Then you can move to the clean- 
up spot.” 

The giant stopped him. “Ra- 
takka not ordinary Quxa; Ratak- 
ka a king. Ratakka not play like 
those serfs. Want special job.” 

A wild thought struck Bill. On 
the playing fields were more than 
two hundred Quxas, most of them 
with a justified and carefully

nurtured dislike for the surly 
slab of muscle before him. In the 
old days, they could do nothing 
individually against him. 

But the Quxas had learned to 
fight as a team. If he could only 
give them the shadow of an ex- 
cuse, trap Ratakka into rousing 
their joint anger, take advantage 
of the predjudices of their new- 
found love for baseball, then Ra- 
takka would get the reckoning 
that he deserved, the days of his 
supremacy would be over, the 
threat of his tyranny would be 
removed from a happy race. 

¥>ILL grinned broadly. “Sure 
thing, old pal,” he said. 

He took off his own baseball 
cap and put it' backward on Ra- 
takka’s head. He signaled for 
someone to bring over a mask 
and chest protector. 

“There’s only one of these at 
each playing field,” Bill explain- 
ed. “In a way, he’s boss of the 
game. Are you suit you want to 
do it? Sometimes the players 
argue with you.” 

“Anyone argue with Ratakka,” 
the giant said, raising a huge fist, 
“Ratakka knock ’em down. Ra- 
takka a king, boss of game.” 

“Okay, boy, you asked for it,” 
Bill said. 

He thrust a whiskbroom into 
Ratakka’s hand. 

“You can be umpire,” said Bill 
Bradley. —DONALD COLVIN

DELAYED 

ACTION 

By CHARLES V. DeVET 



I T was just a hunch. Johnson 
knew that, but his hunches 
had often paid off in the 
past, and now he waited with a 
big man’s patience: For five hours 
he sat in the wooden stands, un- 
der the rumpled Canvas the con- 
cessionaires had put up to 
protect the tourists from Mar- 
lock’s yellow sun. 

The sun was hot and soon 
Johnson’s clothing Was marked 
with large soiled patches of sweat. 
Now and then a light breeze blew 
across the stands from the native 
section and at each breath his 
nostrils crinkled in protest at the 
acrid smell. 




This planet gave him the perfect chance to 
commit the perfect crime — only he couldn't 
remember just what it was he had committed. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



140 



Marlock wasn’t much of a 
planet. Its one claim to fame 
was its widely advertised Nature’s 
Moebius Strip. For eighteen 
months of the year — nine months 
of sub-zero cold, and nine months 
of sultry, sand-driven summer — 
the only outsiders to visit the 
planet came to buy its one export, 
the fur of the desert ox. But 
during the two months of fall 
and two months of spring the 
tourists poured in to gape at the 
Strip. 

Idly, for the hundredth time, 
Johnson let his gaze run over 
the tourists lining up for their 
“thrill” journey out onto the 
Strip. Most of them wouldn’t go 
far; they only wanted to be 
able to say they’d been on it. 
They would build up some pretty 
exciting stories about it by the 
time they returned home. 

There was no sign of Johnson’s 
man. 

qpHE party started out onto the 
Strip. At the first sensation of 
giddiness women squealed and 
most of them turned back. Their 
men came with them, secretly 
relieved at the excuse. 

Johnson watched disinterested- 
ly until only two remained: the 
young couple he had designated 
in his mind as honeymooners . 
The girl had grit. Perhaps more 
than the young fellow with her. 
He was affecting bored bravado, 



laughing loudly as the girl hesi- 
tated, but white streaks had ap- 
peared along his jawline and 
across his temples as he waited 
his turn. 

The young couple had gone far 
enough out now so that they were 
in the first bend of the Strip’s 
twisting dip. Already their bodies 
were leaning sharply, as the mys- 
terious gravity of the Strip held 
them perpendicular with their 
pathway. From where he sat 
Johnson could read nausea on 
their faces. 

When they had followed the 
Strip around until they were 
leaning at a 35-degree angle, the 
girl seemed to lose her nerve. She 
stopped and stood gripping the 
guide rope with both hands. The 
boy said something to her, but 
she shook her head. He’d have to 
show his superiority now by go- 
ing on, but it wouldn’t be for 
much farther, Johnson was will- 
ing to wager. 

The boy took three more steps 
and paused. Then his body bent 
in the middle and he was sick. 
He’d had enough. 

Both turned and hurried back. 
The crowd of tourists, watching 
or waiting their turn, cheered. In 
a few minutes, Johnson knew, the 
kid would be thinking of himself 
as a hero. 

Suddenly Johnson straightened 
up, having spotted a new ar- 
rival, who gripped a tan brief- 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




case tightly under one arm, buy- 
ing a ticket. He had bulky 
shoulders and a black beard. 
Johnson’s man had come. 

• When he saw the bearded man 
go out with the next bunch to 
brave the Strip, Johnson rose and 
walked rapidly to the entrance. 
Elbowing his way through, with 
a murmured apology, he joined 
the waiting group. 

A thin-faced odd-job man 
opened the rope gate and they 
shuffled through. The group must 
have walked fifty paces, with the 
bearded man well up in front and 
Johnson somewhere in the mid- 
dle, before Johnson’s stomach 
sent him its first warning of un- 
rest. Most of those ahead had 
stopped and Johnson threaded 
his way carefully past them. 

Another twenty-five steps and 
he left the others behind. All ex- 
cept the bearded man. He neither 
paused nor looked back, 

Johnson’s stomach had drawn 
up into a tight knot now, and his 
head was beginning to feel light. 
There was a faint ringing in his 
ears. 

By the time he reached the 
end of the guide rope, nausea 
was creeping up from his stomach 
and into his throat. This was as 
far as it was supposed to be safe 
to go; the advertising literature 
had it that here was the point 
of no return. Up ahead his quarry 
was walking half doubled over, 



weaving back and forth, as 
though he were intoxicated. But 
he did not pause. 

Johnson turned to look back, 

and felt his breakfast fighting to 

come up. From his perspective, 

the ground and the spectators 

watching him had swung to a 

position almost perpendicular to 

him. He felt that he was about 

to slide off into space. A wave of 

vertigo swept over him, his legs 

folded and he fell to the ground 

— sicker than he had ever been 
0 

before in his life. Now he knew 
why the man ahead never looked 
back. 

For a moment Johnson won- 
dered whether he should give up. 
But, even as he debated, tenacity 
pulled him to his feet and forced 
him on. 

And now something new was 
added to his vast discomfort. 
Tiny twinges of pain, like small 
electric shocks, began shooting 
up his legs, increasing in intensity 
with each step he took. The 
pain built up until the rusty taste 
of blood in his mouth told him 
that he had bitten into the flesh 
of his lower lip. 

Johnson’s only consolation now 
was the thought that the man 
ahead of him must be suffering 
worse than he. At each step the 
pain increased its tempo, and the 
sound within his head grew to a 
battering roar. Although he felt 
himself at the last frayed ends 



DELAYED ACTION 



143 




of his vitality, he managed to 
stagger on. 

Abruptly he realized that he 
had very nearly overtaken the 
man ahead. Through eyes glazed 
with pain, he saw the other, still 
standing, but swaying with agony 
and sickness. The man seemed 
to be gathering his resources for 
some supreme effort. 

He tottered ahead two more 
steps, threw himself forward — 
and disappeared! 

If he paused now, Johnson 
knew he would never be able to 
move again. Only will power and 
momentum carried him on. He 
stumbled and pitched forward. 
A searing pain traced a path 
through his head and he felt him- 
self falling. 

TTE was certain that he had 
never lost consciousness. The 
ground came up to meet him, 
and, with a last effort, he twisted 
his right shoulder inward. His 
cheek slid along the dirt and he 
lay on his side without strength. 
His legs pushed forward in a 
steady jerking movement as he 
fought to quiet his quivering 
muscles. 

Gradually a soothing lethargy 
bathed Johnson’s body. His pains 
vanished, and the sickness left 
his stomach. 

But something was wrong — 
terribly wrong! 

Slowly he climbed to his feet 



and stood looking about him. He 
was still on the narrow arm of 
the Strip. On either side of him 
banks of white clouds, with the 
consistency of thick smoke, bil- 
lowed and curled about the Strip ( 
— but somehow they left its path- 
way clear. 

Johnson shook his head. The 
wrongness, he guessed, was in his 
own mind. But he was unable to 
determine what it was. Desper- 
ately he marshalled his scattered 
thoughts. Nothing. He took one 
groping step in the direction from 
which he had come — and stag- 
gered back from a wall of pain 
as tangible as a concrete struc- 
ture. 

He had no choice except to go 
forward. There was something he 
must do, he realized, but what 
was it? With the question came 
the answer to what was troubling 
him. 

His memory was gone! 

Or, at least, a great gap had 
been tom through it as though 
carved out by a giant blade. 
Briefly, despair threatened to 
overwhelm him. 

“Hold it!” Johnson spoke 
aloud, and the words sobered 
him. 

All fears became worse when 
not looked at. He had to bring 
this disaster out into the open 
where he could face it; where he 
could assay the damage. He had 
always taken pride in having a 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




logical mind, with thought proc- 
esses as clear and orderly as a 
bookkeeper’s ledger. Closing his 
eyes, he went swiftly over his 
recollections, placing each in its 
appropriate column. 

When he finished he found the 
balance extremely unfavorable, 
but not hopeless. On the asset 
side he remembered: His name. 
Donald Johnson. Right now he 
was on Nature’s Moebius Strip, 
on the planet, Marlock. There 
was some man he had been fol- 
lowing . The rest was on the 
liability side of his balance sheet. 

TTIS name remained: All other 
memory of his own identity 
was gone. There was no recol- 
lection of his reason for being on 
Marlock, or whom he had been 
following or why. That left him 
little with which to work. 

On the other hand, he mused, 
he might never be able to get off 
the Strip, so that didn’t matter 
much. He doubted his ability to 
stand the stress of penetrating 
that electric curtain again. His 
body had been able to take the 
punishment the first time because 
the force had built up gradually. 
Going back would be something 
else again. » 

Still* he planned his next ac- 
tions methodically — only in that 
way could he retain his sanity. 
He would go forward for one 
hour, he decided — he checked his 

DELAYED ACTION 



wrist watch and discovered it 
had run down — and, if he found 
nothing, he would return and take 
his chances • on getting through 
the curtain. 

At the end of ten minutes he 
sighted land ahead of him. When 
he stepped off the Strip, he 
stopped in amazement! 

Somehow the Strip had doubled 
back on itself, and he had re- 
turned to his starting place! 

To his right was the rough 
wooden viewing platform, with 
its green umbrella gone. The 
stands were empty, and not a 
person — tourist or concessionaire 
— was in sight. 

As Johnson stood, perplexed, 
he became aware of numbness 
spreading over his body. He 
brought up his hands and watch- 
ed them slowly turn blue with 
cold. He realized then, in a burst 
of wonder, that winter had come 
to Marlock. Yet it had been 
spring when he had gone out on 
the Strip! 

“4^0QD God, man!” the clerk 
exclaimed. “Have you been 
out in that cold without a coat 
and hat? It must be thirty be- 
low.” 

Johnson was unable to answer. 
He had run from the Strip — 
luckily he remembered its loca- 
tion in relation to the town — but 
it must have been over a mile to 
the hotel. Now, as he stamped his 

145 




feet and beat at his sides with 
numbed hands, he breathed heav- 
ily, gasping great gulps of air 
into his tortured lungs. 

“Come and warm yourself,” 
the clerk said, leading him over 
to a hot water radiator. 

Johnson made no protest. He 
let the heat penetrate until it 
scorched the skin on his back. 
Only after the coldness left his 
body and was replaced by a 
drowsy inertia did his attention 
return to the clerk. 

“Did you ever see me before?” 
Johnson asked. 

The clerk shook his head. “Not 
that I know of.” 

Any further investigation would 
have to wait until the next day, 
Johnson decided. He was dead 
tired, and he had to have some 
sleep. “Sign me up for a room, 
will you?” he asked. 

Once up in his room, Johnson 
counted his money. One hundred 
and fifty-four credits. Enough to 
buy winter clothing and pay his 
room and board for a week. 
Maybe two. What would he do 
if he could learn nothing about 
himself before then? 

The next day Johnson left the 
hotel to buy warm clothes. The 
town’s only store was a half-block 
down the street — as he remem- 
bered it, one of the big Inter- 
planet Company stores. 

Johnson waited until the store- 
keeper finished with two of the 



hairy-eared natives before giving 
his order. As he paid for the 
purchase, he asked: “Have you 
ever seen me before?” 

The storekeeper glanced at him 
uneasily, and shifted his feet be- 
fore answering. “Am I supposed 
to have?” 

Johnson ignored the question. 
“Where can I find the manager?” 
he asked, slipping into the heavy 
coat the clerk held for him. 

“Go up that stairway by the 
door,” the clerk said. “You’ll 
find him in his office.” 

rriHE manager was an old man. 

Old and black, with the deep 
blackness only an Earthborn 
Negro possesses. But his eyes re- 
tained their youthful alertness. 

“Come in and sit down,” he 
told Johnson as he looked up 
and saw him standing in the 
doorway. 

Johnson walked over and took 
the chair at the manager’s left. 
“I’ve had an accident,” he said, 
without preliminary, “and I seem 
to have lost my memory. Do you, 
by any chance, know who I am?” 
“itfever saw you before in my 
life,” the manager answered. 
“What’s your name?” 

“Don Johnson.” 

“Well, at least you remember 
something,” the old man said 
shrewdly. “You didn’t come dur- 
ing the last six months, if that’ll 
help any. There’ve been only two 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ships in that time. Both the 
Company’s. I meet all Company 
ships. If you came in during the 
tourist season I wouldn’t know.” 
“Where else could I make in- 
quiries?” 

• “Son,” the old man said kindly, 
“there’s three Earthmen on Mar- 
lock, that I know of — besides 
yourself, of course — the clerk at 
the hotel, my storekeeper, and 
myself. If you started asking 
questions at the hotel, you’re at 
the end of the line now.” 

Something in Johnson’s expres- 
sion caused the old man to go on. 
“How you fixed for money, son?” 
Johnson drew a deep breath. 
“I’ve got enough to last me about 
two weeks.” 

The manager hesitated, and 
carefully surveyed the ceiling 
with his eyes before he spoke 
again. “I’ve always felt we Earth- 
men should stick together,” he 
said. “If you want a job. I’ll find 
something for you to do and put 
you on the payroll.” 

Twenty minutes later Johnson 
took the job — and twenty years 
later he was still working for the 
Company. He worked for them 
until ... 

J OHNSON was glad when the 
first twinge of fear came that 
it brought no panic. Instead it 
washed through his body, sharp- 
ening his reflexes and alerting 
his muscles for action. 



He never ceased to wonder 
about this faculty he had ac- 
quired for sensing the presence 
of danger. There was no doubt 
in his mind that it had come 
into active function through the 
influence of his environment. But 
it must have been an intrinsic 
part of him even before that, 
waiting to be activated. 

A moment before he had local- 
ized the source of his uneasiness 
— an Earthman, following per- 
haps fifty paces behind him. The 
one quick glance Johnson had 
allowed himself told him his fol- 
lower was above average in 
height, and lean — with the wiry, 
muscular command of himself 
that marked him as a man cap- 
able of well-coordinated action. 

He fought the rising force of 
the next “sand-blaster” boiling in 
from the desert, until he was un- 
able to take a step against it. 
Then he moved behind a mud- 
packed arm projecting from the 
native dwelling at his right. 
Every building had one of these 
protecting arms added on; even 
the concrete buildings in the 
newer, Earth-built section of the 
city conformed to the custom. 
The sandstorms raged intermit- 
tently on Marlock through the 
entire nine month summer sea- 
son, and could not be ignored, 
either by visitors or natives. 

Johnson huddled against the 
projection, but the sand whipped 



DELAYED ACTION 



147 




around the comer and pounded 
at his back. Fine grains sifted 
through his clothing and mingled 
with the clammy sweat of his 
body. He resisted the frantic 
urge to scratch his itching, tor- 
mented skin, for he knew the 
flesh would be rubbed raw in a 
minute and increase the irrita- 
tion to maddening proportions. 

As the “sand-blaster” lost its 
intensity, he came out from his 
shelter and walked away as rap- 
idly as the diminishing force of 
the wind would permit. If he 
could reach his office before his 
stalker closed in, he would be 
safe. 

Suddenly a second Earthman, 
a short length of pipe in his right 
hand, came out of a doorway 
across the street and ran toward 
him. 

Johnson realized that here 
was the source of the warning his 
intuition had sent — not the man 
behind him. 

TT'OR a brief instant, he weighed 
the situation. The man was 
equipped for assault, but the 
chances were he was interested 
only in robbery. Johnson could 
probably save himself a beating 
by surrendering his money with- 
out resistance. He rejected the 
thought. A man had to live with 
his pride, and his self-respect; 
they were more necessary than 
physical well-being. Setting his 



shoulders firmly against the wall, 
he waited. 

The man slowed to a walk 
when he saw his intended victim 
on guard. Johnson had the chance 
to observe him closely. He was a 
short and dark man, heavy of 
bone, with the lower half of his 
face thickly bearded, and sweat - 
making a thin glistening film on 
his high cheekbones. 

Abruptly a voice said, “I 
wouldn’t touch him if I were i 
you.” 

Johnson followed the gaze of 
his near- attacker to his left where 
the lean man he had noted be- 
fore stood with a flat blue pistol 
pointed in their direction. He held 
the pistol like a man who knew 
how to use it. 

“A gun!” the man in the street 
gasped. “Are you crazy?” 

“Better put it away — fast,” 
Johnson warned his ally. “If the 
native police catch you with that 
gun, you’re in bad trouble.” 

The lean man hesitated a mo- 
ment, then shrugged and pock- 
eted the gun. But he kept his : 
hand in the pocket. “I can still 
use it,” he said, to no one in 
particular. 

“Look, chum,” the bearded 
thug grated. “You’re evidently a 
stranger here. Let me give you 
a tip. If you get caught using 
a gun, or even having one on you, 
the police’ll slap you in jail with 
an automatic sentence of ten 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





years. An Earthman couldn’t stay 
alive in one of their so-called 
jails for a year. 

“Now I’ve got a little business 
to attend to with Mr. Johnson, 
and I don’t want any interference. 
So be smart and run along.” 
The smile never left the strang- 
er’s face. “Right now,” he said, 
“I am interested in seeing that 
Mr. Johnson remains in good 
health. If you take another step 
toward him, I’ll shoot. And, if 
I’m not successful in evading the 
police afterwards, you won’t be 
alive to know it.” 

“You’re bluffing,” the bearded 
man said. “I . .” 

“Let me point out something,” 
Johnson interrupted. “Suppose he 
is bluffing and doesn’t use the 
gun: The odds are still two to 
one against you. Are you sure 
you could handle both of us — 
even with the help of that pipe?” 
The man wasn’t sure. He stood 
undecided, then his face showed 
black frustration. He mouthed a 
few choice phrases through his 
beard, turned and walked away. 

*T1HE lean man extended his 
hand. “My name’s Alton 
Hawkes.” 

The rising whine of the next 
“sand-blaster” drowned out John- 
son’s answer. He drew his new 
acquaintance into the shelter of 
a sand -arm. 

As they hugged the corner, 



149 




they felt a third body press 
against them. The musky odor, 
mingled with the taint of old 
leather, told Johnson that their 
cpmpanion was a native. 

The storm eased its force and 
the two Earthmen raised their 
heads to regard the corner’s other 
occupant. He was a mahogany 
brown, almost the exact color of 
the ankle -length leather skirt he 
wore. “Man, he stinks!” Hawkes 
said. 

Their .visitor spread his hairy, 
wide-nostriled nose into the na- 
tive equivalent of a smile. His 
hairy ears twitched with pleasure 
and he swelled his chest. “Blee 
strong all over,” he said. “Want 
him guard?” 

“Why not?” Johnson answered, 
glancing inquiringly at Hawkes. 
He slipped a coin into the ex- 
tended brown palm. “Guard us 
until we get to the big-house 
section.” 

“Pale-smells be very safe,” the 
native said. 

They left their shelter as the 
wind died down and started to- 
ward the taller buildings of the 
foreign section. “I must have said 
the right thing when I said he 
stinks,” Hawkes remarked. 

“Telling a native that is the 
same thing, to him, as calling 
him strong and virile,” Johnson 
answered. “They admit, reluc- 
tantly, that we foreigners have 
some good fighting qualities, but 



we’re still regarded as unmanly 
because of our weak odor. Their 
females wouldn’t look twice at 
either of us.” 

When they reached one of the 
few three-story structures in the 
city, Johnson dismissed their 
guard. They entered the building 
and walked down a short corridor 
and through a door lettered : 

DONALD H. JOHNSON 
District Manager 

Interplanets Trade Company 

“To be frank with you,” 
Hawkes said, as he eased his 
lank body into the chair John- 
son offered, “I had planned to 
learn more about your local ac- 
tivities before I introduced my- 
self. However, I’ve found in the 
past that my first judgment of a 
man is usually right, so I think 
I’ll get down to business im- 
mediately.” He drew a set of 
papers from an inside pocket 
and tossed them on the desk in 
front of Johnson. “I’m a Com- 
pany Secret Service man,” he 
said. 

J OHNSON raised his eyebrows, 
but looked at the papers 
without comment. He glanced up 
at Hawkes. 

“Do you recognize either of the 
men in the pictures?” Hawkes 
asked, when he saw that John- 
son had no intention of speaking.

Unhurriedly Johnson picked up 
the papers and removed a rub- 
ber binder. He pulled out two 
photos and laid them on the desk 
in front of him. “The bearded 
one is the man who waylaid me,” 
he said. “Of course.” 

“Look at both a little closer,” 
Hawkes suggested, “and see if 
you don’t notice something else.” 
Johnson studied the pictures. 
“There’s no doubt about the 
first,”’ he murmured. “Evidently 
I’m supposed to recognize the 
other also.” Abruptly he sat erect. 
“They’re both the same man,” 
he exclaimed. “Only in the sec- 
ond picture h«’s clean-shaven.” 
Hawkes nodded. “There’s a 
story about those two pictures,” 
he said. “But first, let me fill you 
in on some background. You 
know that Interplanets has 
branches on more than a thou- 
sand worlds. Because of this wide- 
spread operation it’s particularly 
vulnerable to robbery. But it 
would cost more than the Com- 
pany’s earnings to post adequate 
guards on every station. And it 
would be impractical to depend 
on the protection of the local 
governments, many of which are 
extremely primitive. On the other 
hand, allowing themselves to be 
robbed with impunity would be 
financial suicide.” 

•Johnson nodded. “Of course.” 
“That,” Hawkes continued, “is 
where the Company’s Secret 



Service comes in. It never lets up 
on the effort it will make to solve 
a robbery and bring the perpe- 
trators to justice. And it never 
quits, once it begins an investiga- 
tion. That policy has proven very 
effective in discouraging thievery. 
During the Company’s entire 
tenure there have been less than 
a dozen unsolved thefts — and two 
of them occurred right here on 
Marlock.” 

“I was a clerk with the Com- 
pany at the time of the sec- 
ond,” Johnson said reminiscently. 
“Been with them about .three 
years then. That must have been 
over twenty years ago. I . .” He 
paused and looked down. “I re- 
member,” he said. “The picture 
without the beard . That’s the 
thief. The photograph was taken 
by one of the automatic cameras 
set up for just that purpose; 
we still use them. But they never 
found the man.” 

“That’s right,” Hawkes agreed. 
“That robbery occurred a little 
over twenty years ago. And the 
other picture you have was taken 
at the time of the first robbery — 
approximately twenty-five years 
before that.” 

“But it isn’t possible,” Johnson 
protested. “These pictures are of 
the same man. And there’s ob- 
viously no twenty-five year 
spread in age between them. Un- 
less . .” 

“Unless one is the other’s 



DELAYED ACTION 



151 




father, or a relative that resem- 
bles him very closely?” Hawkes 
finished. “Look at the pictures 
again. There’s the same scar on 
both foreheads, the same pock- 
mark on the right cheek; our spe- 
cial section has even made meas- 
urements of the comparative sizes 
of the nose, ears and other fea- 
tures. There’s no possible doubt 
that the pictures are of the same 
man,” 

"TTOW do you explain it?” 
-*■■■- Johnson asked. 

“I don’t,” Hawkes replied 
quietly. “That’s one of the things 
I’m here to learn. But did you 
notice this? The man we en- 
countered this afternoon was not 
only the same as the one on those 
pictures: he still looks the same. 

JtVe might, for the sake of argu- 
ment, grant that a man’s ap- 
pearance would change only 
slightly in twenty-five years. But 
when you add another twenty- 
three on top of that — and he’s 
still unchanged . ?” 

“If you’re certain that he’s the 
man, why don’t you arrest him?” 
Johnson asked: 

“Can we arrest a man appar- 
ently about thirty years old and 
accuse him of a crime committed 
forty-eight years ago— or even 
twenty-three years ago?” 

“I suppose not,” Johnson 
agreed. “What do you intend to 
do?” 



“I haven’t decided yet. First 
I’ll have to learn more about the 
situation here. You can help me 
with that. Right now I’d like to 
know something about the native 
customs— especially in regard to 
legal matters.” i 

“Their laws are fairly simple,” 
Johnson began. “There’s no law 
against stealing or taking by 
force anything you can get away 
with. That sounds absurd by I 
Earth standards, it prevents the I 
amassing of more goods than an ] 
individual needs, and makes for | 
fairly equitable distribution. If a ; 
native somehow acquires a sud- 
den amount of wealth — goods, in 
their case — he must hire guards 
to protect it. Guarding is a ma- 
jor occupation. They do aa espe- 
cially big business during the ' 
tourist seasons. In time the pay i 
of the guards will eat up any na- 
tive’s surplus. Either way — by 
loss or guard pay — the wealth is 
soon redistributed.” 

“Can they even kill one an- 
other with impunity?” 

“No. Their laws are rigid in 
that respect. In the process of — - 
relieving another of his property, 
they must neither break a major 
bone, nor inflict permanent dam- 
age. If they disobey, they are 
tortured to death in the public 
square.” 

Hawkes asked, “Who enforces 
their law?” 

“One of the clans. Its members 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



are supported in their duties by 
all the others. And there’s a 
permanent open season on mur- 
derers. Anyone, police or civilian 
may revenge a victim.” 

“How about the law against 
carrying firearms?” 

“With them, intent is tanta- 
mount to commission,” Johnson 
replied. “Onl-y foreigners are ever 
foolish enough to be caught 
armed. However, all native laws 
apply to them also. The only 
concession the Company has been 
able to force is that a foreign 
offender isn’t tortured: He’s put 
in jail for ten years. None ever 
4ve to come out.” 

“I see,” Hawkes said. “Inter- 
esting. However, the immediate 
situation is this. I’ve been sent 
here because the Service received 
reports that our bearded friend 
had made another appearance. 
And we believe it’s safe to as- 
sume that he’s here to attempt 
a third robbery. Right now we’ll 
have to pass over his trick of 
longevity. Our problem is to catch 
him in the act. When do you 
think he’ll make his play?” 

“It’ll have to be some time be- 
fore tomorrow noon”’ Johnson 
answered. “Under our setup we 
accept furs from the natives 
whenever they’re brought in. But 
we pay off only once a year. That 
way I’m not burdened with 
guarding money the whole year 
around. I have well over fifty 



thousand credits in the safe now. 
And tomorrow I begin paying 
off.” 

“Then we’ll have to be ready 
for him,” Hawkes said, “though 
I don’t expect him until tonight. 
Probably just about the time 
you’re ready to close. He’ll need 
you to open the safe. I can count 
on your help?” 

Johnson nodded. 

fTYHAT night as they waited in 
-*• his office, Johnson turned to 
Hawkes. “I’ve been giving some 
thought to what you told me this 
afternoon about the robberies. I 
have a theory that might account 
for some of the things we don’t 
understand.” 

“Yes?” Hawkes looked closely 
at Johnson. 

“You’ve probably heard of our 
tourist attraction called Nature’s 
Moebius Strip? As far as we 
know, no one has ever gone be- 
yond a certain point — and re- 
turned. Suppose there’s a time 
flaw at that point — and the 
bearded man has somehow 
learned about it. Suppose any- 
one completing the Moebius cir- 
cle, and returning, finds — say, 
twenty years have elapsed, while 
to him only a few minutes have 
passed?” 

“Go on.” Hawkes leaned for- 
ward intently. 

“He makes his first holdup,” 
Johnson continued, “and goes 



DELAYED ACTION 



153 





around the Strip. When he comes 
out twenty years later they’re no 
longer looking for him. He leaves 
Marlock, and during the next 
five years he goes through the 
money he stole. He returns and 
repeats the process. This time the 
money lasts only three years. 
Now he’s back to try it again. 
Do you see how that would tie 
everything up in a neat little 
package?” 

Hawkes smiled, as he relaxed 
and sat back. “A bit too neat,” he 
said. “Also, you don’t have an 
ounce of concrete evidence to 
back up your theory.” 

“That’s right. I don’t,” John- 
son agreed. 

Outside the door a board 
creaked. Johnson glanced quickly 
across the room to where Hawkes 
sat with a pistol on his lap. 
Hawkes’ eyebrows raised, but he 
made no sound. 

QUDDENLY the door was 
^ kicked open and the black- 
bearded stranger stood framed in 
the doorway. “Raise ’em!” he 
barked. The gun in his hand was 
aimed at Johnson, 

The man took two steps into 
the room. Hawkes shifted slightly 
in his chair and the gunman’s 
head swiveled in his direction. 
The slug from Hawkes' pistol 
made a small blue hole in the 
upper left comer of his forehead. 

The thug’s face tipped up, 



DELAYED ACTION 



155 



shocked and unbelieving. He 
swayed slowly before he fell 
backward, his body rigid. His fur 
cap flew from his head as he 
struck the floor. 

“I thought we’d better play it 
safe,” Hawkes said as he rose and 
walked over to the fallen man. 
He slipped his gun into his pocket 
before he bent and picked up the 
cap at his feet. He dropped it 
over the upturned face. 

For a long moment the silence 
held thin as the two men looked 
at each other. Hawkes stood, wip- 
ing his right hand on his trouser 
leg. Johnson toyed idly with the 
gun he had picked up from the 
desk in front of him. 

Finally Hawkes let his body 
sag into a chair at Johnson’s, 
right. “This is always a dirty 
business,” he said sourly. 

Johnson sat down also. “Did 
you notice the look on his face 
when he saw you, and you shot 
him?” he asked, abstractedly 
turning the pistol in his hand. 
“Funny thing. In that half-second 
before he fell an article I read 
somewhere flashed into my mind. 
It seems that during the French 
Revolution a certain doctor got 
to wondering just how long a 
man’s brain remained active after 
his head had been cut off. He per- 
suaded some of his friends who 
were due to be guillotined to co- 
operate in a series of tests. Each 
man was to keep blinking his 



eyes as long as possible after his 
head left his body, as a sign that 
he was still conscious. The doc- 
tor counted as high as six winks.” 
“Very interesting, I’m sure,” 
Hawkes said guardedly. “But a 
bit morbid, isn’t it?” 

“I was wondering,” Johnson 
went on as though he had not 
heard the other, “whether he 
was still conscious for that in- 
stant after you shot him. And if 
that brought the look of surprise 
to his face.” 

T T AWKES turned in his chair to 
face Johnson fully. “You’re 
driving at something,” he said 
sharply. “Get to the point.” 

“Personally I’ve wondered at a 
few things about you myself,” 
Johnson said. He held the gun 
steadily in his hand now, no 
longer pretending to play with it. 
“I told you that our second rob- 
bery occurred while I was a clerk 
with the Company,” he went on. 
“They jerked me in to the Home 
Office, and for a while I had a 
pretty rough time ... You know, 
when I joined the Company, I 
was an amnesiac. I remembered 
my name, but that’s about 
all . .” 

“No, I didn’t know,” Hawkes 
muttered, growing slightly paler. 

“I learned then from the Home 
Office that I had been a member 
of their Secret Service some 
twenty years earlier. I’d been sent 



156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




here to investigate the first rob- 
bery. And I had disappeared. 
Naturally, they had , suspected 
me. 

“However, they had no evi- 
dence, and when I reappeared 
twenty years later they played it 
smart by just waiting, instead of 
arresting me. When the 'second 
robbery occurred, they closed in. 

“The only thing that saved me 
was the fact that tests proved my 
memory was really gone, and 
that I had told the truth — as I 
knew it. From the few scraps of 
information I retained — about 
being out on the Moebius Strip — 
they and I arrived at the theory 
I mentioned a short time ago. I 
was sent back here to wait. The 
Company never gives up. Re- 
member?” 

“Are you insinuating that I was 
in cahoots with this fellow here?” 
Hawkes asked harshly. 

“I’d say it was more than an 
insinuation,” Johnson replied. 
“You made several other slips. 
In the first place, Secret Service 
men are usually better informed 
about a situation they’re investi- 
gating than you seemed to be. 
Also, those identification papers 
you showed me were faked.” 

^T’HE skin along the bridge of 
Hawkes’ hose had drawn 
tight, and now his lips grew nar- 
rower. “In that case, why did I 
save you from that man this 



afternoon?” he asked. “And why 
would I shoot him now?” 

“Your saving me was an act, 
to get into my confidence. You 
shot him so you wouldn’t have to 
split the loot. I figure you were in 
with him on the second robbery 
also. There had to be someone 
because his memory would be 
gone, when he came off the Strip. 
But you weren’t satisfied. To- 
gether you decided to pull off an- 
other robbery while you were 
here and double the spoils. Then 
you decided you wanted it all for 
yourself and you shot him.” 
“There’s one big flaw in your 
reasoning,” Hawkes pointed out. 
“How did I plan to get away? 
The only ships leaving here for 
several months belong to the 
Company. Do you think I’d be 
foolish enough to expect them to 
let me slip out on one of their 
ships?” 

“No. I think you intended to 
go out on the Strip yourself.” 
“All right then,” Hawkes coun- 
tered. “You admitted that this 
was a two-man job. How could I 
protect myself when I returned, 
if I knew in advance that I 
wouldn’t know who I was, let 
alone what I had done?” 

“I’ll come back, to that in a 
minute,” Johnson said. “But now 
I’d advise you to drop your gun 
on the floor and give yourself up. 
You’ve got nothing to gain by 
carrying on the bluff. You know 



DELAYED ACTION 



157 




I’ll never let you get to the Strip. 
And, once I put you on the ship, 
the Company will take over.” 

H AWKES’ shoulders drooped. 

Finally he smiled raggedly. 
"There’s no use my arguing any 
longer,” he said. “But you’ve 
made the mistake of under- 
estimating me, my friend. I’ve 
lost my gamble. That's all. You 
have nothing on me. I’m not as 
ignorant of native law as I may 
have pretended. Granted, I am 
carrying a lethal weapon. But I’m 
on private property. That’s legal. 
I shot a man. But only in defense 
of my own life. His gun. on the 
floor will prove he came in armed. 
So I’m clean as far as the natives 
are concerned. Right?” 

Johnson nodded. 

“And, as for the Company, 
what will they hold me for? They 
can’t prove any connection be- 
tween me and him.” Hawkes in- 
dicated the man on the floor. 
“And this robbery — it never act- 
ually came off. Earth laws don’t 
allow prosecution for intent. 
Now, where does that leave 
you?” 

Johnson stood up. “You’re 
right — as far as you went,” he 
said. “But, returning to your ear- 
lier question about one man pull- 
ing this job, I asked myself how 
I would do it, if it had to be done 
alone. And I found a way. You’d 
probably figure the same one. 



Now I’ll take that paper in your 
pocket. It will serve very well 
as a confession.” 

Suddenly Hawkes’ right hand 
streaked toward a side pocket. 
Johnson leaned forward and 
brought the flat of his gun across 
the other’s temple. 

As Hawkes sagged, Johnson 
ripped open his coat and took out 
a sealed envelope. He removed a 
sheet of paper and read: 

This has been written ior my own 
information. My name is Alton 
Hawkes. I have robbed the Inter- 
planets Company and gone out on the 
Strip with the money. When I read 
this my memory will be gone and 
twenty years will have elapsed.
