MOVING DAY (II) 



17'OR those who came in late, 
I’ll recapitulate a recent argu- 
ment I had with myself: 

One of the most urgent prob- 
lems facing humanity is growth 
of population, which is increas- 
ing at the rate of 25,000,000 a 
year. Malthus felt that unless 
birth is somehow controlled, war, 
famine and disease must keep 
population in line with food pro- 
duction. That, of course, was 
150 years ago, before agriculture 
was mechanized. Also, the most 
devastating wars and famines 
have occurred since then, though 
nothing to compare with the great 
plagues and fires of the Middle 
Ages. None of Malthus’s supposed 
population checks has yet worked. 

What can, then? Science fic- 
tion authors generally propose 
migration — to other planets, vari- 
ous parts of the world, even to 
bubble cities under the sea. 

Right now, today, the solution 
is no solution at all. The fewest 
people we could move to control 
even the present dangerously high 
level is the annual increase of 
25,000,000. We’re a long way 
from being able to transport them 
to other planets. 

That doesn’t mean our authors 
arc being visionary. We, better 
than most, realize that the im- 
possibility of one generation is 



the commonplace of another. 

But population is unreasonable 
— it obstinately refuses to stop 
growing until we have the an- 
swer. Meanwhile, half -measures 
will have to serve. Provided, that 
is, that we can find them. 

The Amazing Amazon by Wil- 
lard Price (John Day, N. Y., $4) 
vividly charts a “last” frontier 
that is every bit as amazing as 
the author claims, and which 
could help immensely to feed the 
world, as well as supply minerals 
and ores that are becoming more 
and more scarce elsewhere. 

Even aside from this dis- 
cussion, the Amazon River is 
astronomical enough in size and 
phenomena to belong to science 
fiction rather than fact. Just listen : 

The mouth of the Amazon is 
two hundred miles wide — ten 
times as wide as the English 
Channel between Dover and Ca- 
lais, twice as wide as the Medi- 
terranean between Sicily and 
North Africa. 

This “moving sea,” as Price 
justly calls it, represents one- 
fifth of all the running fresh 
water on Earth. 

“Place the mouth of the Ama- 
zon at New York and its arms 
would reach up into Canada and 
down into Mexico and almost to 
California,” Price states. With 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



its 1100 known tributaries, many 
of them larger than the Rhine, 
it drains 3,000,000 square miles of 
land — an area almost as huge as 
the entire U.S.A. 

Ocean vessels can go upriver 
2400 miles, along with sharks, 
tarpons, sawfishes, swordfishes, 
porpoises and manatees, which 
thrive in the Amazon. 

This most gigantic of rivers 
even has a tide, a monstrous 
wave known as the pororoca, ten 
to fifteen feet high, which races 
up as far as Santarem once a 
month at the murderous rate of 
45 miles an hour. 

There are three large islands 
at the mouth of the river, one 
of them, Marajd, as big as Den- 
mark or Switzerland. 

One hundred miles offshore, 
a ship can drop buckets and 
bring up drinkable water, for the 
sixty billions gallons per hour 
sweep out with such force that 
the river continues flowing right 
in the ocean. 

All of this falls into the cate- 
gory of “Well, what do you 
know?” information, but that is 
not the reason for this debate. 
Amazonia is unthinkably rich — 
it contains the greatest deposits 
of high-grade iron ore in the 
world, industrial diamonds, gold, 
manganese and practically every 
other metal and mineral — and 
geologists declare that half of 
Brazil floats on petroleum. Its 



forests abound in precious wood 
of all sorts, from building timber 
to medicinal roots, barks and ber- 
ries. Nowhere on Earth is there 
deeper, blacker topsoil. 

What’s holding us back? Not 
the animals, numerous and fear- 
some as many of them are; they 
could be exterminated right down 
to the last anaconda and piranha, 
the notorious cannibal fish. The 
swarming insects are the major 
problem. Price’s chapter on them 
is exciting — and dismaying. But 
he’s right : we have techniques 
that could clear them out. 

Logically, it would seem that 
this is a call for a mass migra- 
tion to Amazonia. Actually, there 
is no need for millions to lift 
anchor and head for the jungle. 
The small number of food grow- 
ers we rely on isn’t commonly 
known, but this may give you an 
idea — 12% of the producers sup- 
ply over 50% of America’s food. 

As Price points out, the con- 
quest of this vast terrain is no 
job for individuals, corporations 
or even any one nation, regard- 
less of its wealth. It is properly 
the business of the entire world, 
since the entire world would bene- 
fit. 

Wait for space travel so we 
can have planets to provide food 
and ores? Not when Amazonia is 
richer than any of the worlds in 
the whole Solar System!

The Telenizer 




By DON THOMPSON 



W HEN I saw the blood 
dripping from the tap 
in the bathtub, I knew 
that someone had a telenosis 
beam on me, and I breathed a 
very audible sigh of relief. 

During the past few days, I 
had begun to wonder if I was 
really cracking up. 

When you start seeing visions 
of a bearded gent with a halo, 
or having vague but wonderful 
dreams about some sort of per- 
fect world, feeling intense loyal- 
ties to undefined ideals, and 
experiencing sudden impulses, 
sometimes cruel and sometimes 
kind — you know that some- 
thing’s wrong. 

At least I do. 




Langston had technicolor delusions; inanimate objects came 



alive in his hands; THEY were persecuting him, out to get 



him . what a relief it was to know he wasn't going insane l 



THE TELENIZER 



7 



If he — whoever he was — had 
just kept up the slow, subtle pace 
he’d maintained for the past two 
or three days, he would have had 
me in a little while. For whatever 
he wanted. 

But now, he’d overplayed his 
hand. I knew, at least, what was 
going on. Who was doing it, or 
why, I still didn’t know — nor 
whether I could stand it, even 
knowing. 

npHE thick, bright red blood 
dripping steadily from the 
water tap in the bath tub wasn’t 
so bad. 

I stood before the mirror, with 
my softly humming razor in my 
hand, and I watched the blood 
ooze from the tap, quiver as it 
grew heavy and pregnant, then 
pull itself free and fall with a 
dull plonk to the enamel as an- 
other drop began to form. 

That wasn’t so bad. But my 
sigh of relief became a gurgle of 
almost hysterical apprehension 
as I braced myself for what 
might come, with the telenizer 
knowing that I was aware. 

There was something I could 
do— should do — but my mind re- 
fused to focus. It bogged down in 
a muck of unreasoning terror and 
could only scream Why? Why? 
Why? 

The drops of blood from the 
water tap increased both in size 
and rapidity, as I watched. 



Heavy, red, marble-sized tears 
followed one another from the 
tap, plonk, plonk, plonk, splash- 
ing in the tub and on the floor. 
Faster and faster, and then the 
drip became a flow, a gush, as 
though the vein of some giant 
creature had been slashed. 

The tub filled rapidly, and 
blood flowed like a crimson wa- 
terfall over the edge and across 
the floor toward me. 

I heard a tiny howling, and 
looked down. 

I screamed and threw the soft, 
brown, fuzzy, squirming puppy- 
thing that had been a razor into 
the advancing tide of blood. 

The fuzzy thing shattered 
when it hit the blood, and each 
of the thousand pieces became 
another tiny puppy-thing that 
grew and grew, yapping and 
swimming in the blood. The tide 
was now rising about my shoes. 

I backed away from the mir- 
ror, trembling violently. I forced 
myself to slosh through the 
thick blood into the bedroom, 
groping for a bottle of whisky on 
the bureau. 

“ V^^HAT the hell are you do- 
** ing here?” the boss asked 
when I opened his office door 
and peeked in. “You’re supposed 
to be in Palm Beach. Well, damn 
it, come on in!” 

I clung to the door firmly as 
I maneuvered myself through the 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



opening. And when I closed the 
door. I leaned back against it 
heavily. 

I could see the boss — Carson 
Newell, managing editor of Inter- 
galaxy News Service — half rising 
from behind his big desk across 
the room; but he was pretty dim 
and I couldn’t get him to stay in 
one place. His voice was clear 
enough, though: 

“Must be mighty important to 
bring you back from . Damn 
it, Langston, are you drunk?” 

I grinned then, and said, “Car- 
shon. Carton. Old boy. Do you 
know that telenosis therapy is no 
sonofabitchin’ good on alcohol- 
ics?” 

Carson Newell sat back down, 
frowning. 

I stumbled to a chair by the 
corner of his desk and gripped 
the arms tightly. 

“Telenosis therapy,” I repeat- 
ed, “is just no — ” 

“Snap out of it,” Newell bark- 
ed. “It’s no good on dumb ani- 
mals, either, and you’re probably 
out of range by now, anyway.” 
He took a small bottle from his 
desk and tossed a yellow Anti- 
Alch pill across the desk to me. 
I popped it into my mouth. 

It didn’t take long to work. A 
few minutes later, still weak and 
a little trembly, I said, “Would 
have thought of that myself, if I 
hadn’t been so damn drunk.” 
The boss grunted. “Now what’s 



this business about telenosis?” 
“Somebody’s been using it on 
me,” I said. “Maliciously. Damn 
near drowned in a lake of blood 
from a water faucet.” 

“Couldn’t have been DTs?” 
“I’m serious. It’s been going on 
for three or four days now. Not 
the blood. That’s what gave it 
away. But other things.” 

“You’ve been working pretty 
hard lately,” Newell reminded 
me. 

“Which is why I’m on vacation 
and all nice and relaxed. Or at 
least, I was. No, it’s not that. 
Listen. Carson, I admit that I’m 
no technical expert on telenosis. 
But a long time ago — seven or 
eight years ago, I guess — I did a 
feature series on it. I learned a 
little bit. Enough to save my life 
this time.” 

Newell shrugged. “Okay. You 
probably know more about it 
than I do. I just know it’s damn- 
ed restricted stuff.” He paused 
thoughtfully. “Any missing teie- 
nizer equipment would cause a 
helluva fuss, and there hasn’t 
been any fuss.” 

“No machines in Palm Beach 
or vicinity that somebody on the 
inside could be using illegally?” 
And then I answered that ques- 
tion myself: “No ... I doubt it. 
The machines are used only in 
the larger hospitals.” 

“Don’t suppose you have any 
hunches?” 



THE TELENIZER 



9 



I shook my head slowly, frown- 
ing. “You couldn’t really call it 
a hunch. Just a bare possibility. 
But I noticed on a news report 
the other day that Isaac Grogan 
— you know, ‘the Millionaire 
Mayor of Memphis,’ released 
about a month ago, bribery and 
corruption sentence — anyway, 
he’s taken up temporary resi- 
dence in Palm Beach.” 

The boss rubbed his chin. “As 
I recall, you did an expose series 
on him four or five years ago. 
Corroborated by official investi- 
gation, and Grogan was later sen- 
tenced. You thinks he’s after 
revenge?” 

I raised a hand warningly. 
“Now, hold on — I said it was a 
bare possibility. All I know is 
that Grogan hates my guts — or 
might think he has some reason 
to. I know that Grogan is in Palm 
Beach, and that I’ve been under 
telenosis attack. There’s no nec- 
essary connection at all.” 

“No.” Newell said. “But it’s 
something to start on.” He looked 
at his wrist watch. “Tell you 
what. It’s nearly noon now. Let’s 
go out for lunch, and while I’m 
thinking, you can tell me all you 
remember about telenosis.” 

TT’S altogether possible that 
you may have no more than 
barely heard of telenosis — its 
technical details are among the 
most closely guarded secrets of 



our time. So I’ll go over some of 
the high spots of what I told 
Newell. 

Mind you, I’m no authority on 
the subject, and it has been a full 
seven years since I have done any 
research on it. However, I learn- 
ed all I know from Dr. Homer 
Reighardt, who, at the time, was 
the world’s outstanding author- 
ity. 

Telenosis, nowadays, is con- 
fined almost exclusively to use in 
psychiatric hospitals and correc- 
tive institutions. It’s used chiefly 
on neurotics. In cases of extreme 
dementia, it’s worthless. In fact, 
the more normal you are, the 
more effective the telenosis. 

Roughly — without going into 
any of the real technicalities — 
it’s this way: 

Science has known for a long 
time that electrical waves ema- 
nate from the brain. The waves 
can be measured on an electro- 
encaphalograph, and vary with 
the physiological and psycho- 
logical condition of the indi- 
vidual. Extreme paranoia, for 
example, or epilepsy, or alcohol- 
ism are accompanied by violent 
disturbances of the waves. 

Very interesting, but . 

It wasn’t until 2037 that Pro- 
fessor Martin James decided that 
these brain waves are comparable 
to radio waves, and got busy in- 
venting a device to listen in on 
them. 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The result, of course, was tele- 
nosis. The machine that James 
came up with, after twenty years 
of work, could not only listen in 
on a person’s thoughts, which are 
carried on the brain waves, but 
it could transmit messages to the 
brain from the outside. 

“Unless the waves are in a 
state of disturbance caused by 
alcohol or insanity or some such 
thing?” Newell commented. 

I nodded. 

“The word ‘telenosis’ comes 
from ‘hypnosis,’ doesn’t it?” 
“Yes, but not very accurate- 
ly,” I said. “In hypnosis, you 
need some sort of visual or audi- 
tory accompaniment. With tele- 
nosis, you can gain control of a 
person’s mind directly, through 
the brain waves.” 

“You say ‘gain control of a 
person’s mind,’ ” Newell said. 
“Do you mean that if you tell 
someone who is under telenosis 
to do something, he’s got to do 
it?” 

“IVrOT necessarily,” I said. “All 
' you can do with telenosis is 
transmit thoughts to a person — 
counting visual and auditory sen- 
sations as thoughts. If you can 
convince him that the thoughts 
you’re sending are his thoughts 
. then you can make him 
do almost anything. But if he 
knows or suspects he’s being tele- 
nized — ” 



"I’m with you,” Newell inter- 
rupted. “He still gets the thoughts 
— visions and sounds or what 
have you — but he doesn’t have to 
obey them.” 

I nodded. My mind was skip- 
ping ahead to more immediate 
problems. “Don’t you suppose we 
ought to notify Central Investi- 
gation Division right away? This 
is really a problem for them." 

But Newell was there ahead of 
me. “So was the Memphis af- 
fair,” he said. 

I raised my eyebrows. 

“Meaning,” the boss continued, 
“that I’d like to give your hunch 
a play first.” 

“But it’s not even a hunch,” I 
objected. “How?” 

“Well, by having you inter- 
view Grogan, for instance . 

I opened my mouth and almost 
shook my head, but Newell hur- 
ried on. “Look, Earl, it’s been a 
long time since Intergalaxy has 
scored a good news beat. Not 
since the Memphis expose, in 
fact. Remember that? Remember 
how good it felt to have your 
name on articles published all 
over the world? Remember all 
the extra cash? The fame?” 

I grunted. 

“Now before you say any- 
thing,” Newell said, "remember 
that when you started on that 
case you didn’t have a thing more 
concrete to go on than you have 
right now — just a half a hunch. 



THE TELENIZER 



11 



Isn’t that right? Admit it!” 
“M’m.” 

“Well, isn’t it worth a chance? 
What can we lose?” 

“Me, maybe. But . 

The boss said nothing more. 
He knew that if he let me do the 
talking, I’d soon argue myself 
into it. Which I did. 

Five minutes later, I shrug- 
ged. “Okay. What, specifically, 
do you have in mind?” 

“Let’s go back to the office,” 
Newell said. 

TT WAS just a short walk. Or, 
-*■ I should say, it would have 
been a short walk, if we had 
walked. 

But New York was one of the 
very last cities to convert to the 
“level” transportation system. It 
had been one hell of an engineer- 
ing feat, but for Amerpean in- 
genuity and enterprise nothing is 
impossible, so the job had finally 
been tackled and completed just 
within the past year. And the 
novelty of the ambulator bands 
on pedestrian levels was still 
strong for native New Yorkers. 

So instead of leaving the res- 
taurant on the vehicle level, 
where we happened to be, and 
taking an old fashioned sidewalk 
stroll to the IGN building, New- 
ell insisted on taking the esca- 
lator up to the next level and 
then gliding along on an am- 
band. 



That’s just the sort of person 
he is. 

When we got back up to his 
office, he asked, “Isn’t there some 
sort of defense against telenosis? 
I mean, other than alcohol or in- 
sanity?” 

I thought for a moment. 
“Shouldn’t be too hard to devise 
one. All you need is something 
to set up interference vibrations 
on the same band as the brain 
waves you're guarding.” 

“Sounds simple as hell. Could 
one of our men do it?” 

“A telenosis technician at one 
of the hospitals could do it quick- 
er,” I suggested. 

“Without the sanction of 
C.I.D.? I doubt that.” 

“That’s right,” I agreed. 
“Okay. I’ll run down to Tech- 
nology and see what we can work 
out. It may take two or three 
days — ” 

“I’ll see that it gets top prior- 
ity. I want you to get back to 
Palm Beach as soon as you can.” 
As I was getting up to leave, 
Newell said, “Say, by the way, 
how’s that health cult in Palm 
Beach — Suns-Rays Incorporat- 
ed? Anything on that?” 

Suns-Rays Incorporated was 
one of the chief reasons I was 
taking my vacation in Palm 
Beach, Fla., instead of in Sacra- 
mento, Calif., my home town. 
Carson Newell had heard about 
this crackpot religious group that 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was having a convention in Palm 
Beach, and he couldn’t see why 
one of his reporters shouldn’t 
combine business and pleasure. 

And maybe that tells you a 
little more of the sort of person 
he is. 

“It’s a complete fraud,” I told 
him. “They worship a glorified 
sunlamp and take regular treat- 
ments. Same time, they follow a 
strict diet and system of exer- 
cises — have their own little spot 
on one of the beaches. Guaran- 
teed to cure what ails you.” 
“Who’s the head?” Newell 
asked. “How many are there?” 
"About twenty-five or thirty 
members, I’d say. That’s not 
counting the few curiosity-seek- 
ers. like me. And nobody in par- 
ticular seems to be in charge 
right now. I guess the big boss 
died, and they’re holding this 
confab to elect a new one. Sup- 
posed to have the elections to- 
day. come to think of it. There’s 
a great big scoop I missed.” 

"Any real news value in it?” 

I shook my head. “Feature 
story, maybe, but it’s pretty run- 
of-the-mill stuff, even at that.” 
“Well, stay with it." Newell 
said. “Just in case nothing pops 
on this telenosis deal. And get 
that defense mech as soon as pos- 
sible.” 

"Do I get a real vacation after 
this is all over?” I asked, knowing 
what the answer would be. 



“Scram," Newell replied. “I’m 
a busy man. Get going!” 

T ATE afternoon of the next 
^ day, my defense mechanism 
was ready. They had taken a 
reading of my brain wave with 
a makeshift electroencaphalo- 
graph, and then a couple of elec- 
tronics boys had tinkered around 
until they had a gadget that 
would throw out vibrations on 
exactly my wave-band. 

Of course, not having any tele- 
nosis equipment, we weren’t able 
to make a real check of the con- 
traption’s effectiveness. I had to 
take the technologists’ word that 
It would work. 

Frankly, I didn’t feel any too 
well defended as I hopped the 
five o’clock stratoliner back to 
Palm Beach. 

The defense mech was en- 
closed in a black case that looked 
like a portable radio or a port- 
able typewriter or a small suit- 
case. When you opened the lid. 
there was a flat surface having 
only one dial — for volume. The 
vibrations had a radius of about 
three-quarters of a mile. 

It was after six when I got 
back to my hotel. I had Grogan’s 
address, and he wasn’t too far 
from where I was staying — but 
Grogan is not the sort of person 
on whom you make a business 
call after business hours. 

My confidence in the defense 



THE TELENIZER

mech hadn’t grown, but I knew 
of another sure-fire defense, so 
after dinner I went to the bar to 
start setting it up. 

But I lugged the thirty-pound 
portable along, anyway, wishing 
that it looked a little more like 
a briefcase instead of a typewriter 
or a radio. 

Not that it really mattered, 
though. I could have carried an 
open bird cage with a live and 
screaming Calypsian grimp, odor 
and all, and still not have at- 
tracted any attention — because it 
wouldn’t have been any more un- 
usual than some of the guests at 
the hotel. 

For a student of interplanetary 
biology, this would be a perfect 
observation post. There aren’t 
many forms of extraterrestrial life 
that can accommodate them- 
selves to Earth’s conditions, but 
there are spots that go out of 
their way to provide suitable con- 
ditions for anything that comes 
along, and this was one of them. 

TN THE two weeks I had been 
here, I had seen only one 
Calypsian dominant, and he 
didn’t happen to have a grimp 
with him. But there were a pair 
of Uranian galgaque — squat, 
gray, midget honeymooners — 
who smelled just as bad. They 
left a few days after I got here. 

Then there had been at least 
half a dozen flimsy, ethereal lit- 



tle Venusians at one time or an- 
other, dragging themselves 
around and looking unhappy as 
hell. None of them stayed more 
than a few days, and they spent 
most of their time in the water. 

I noticed one or two hairy, 
apelike dominants from Jupiter’s 
third moon, and a few of the 
snaky, scaly, six-limbed crea- 
tures from the second. In addi- 
tion, there was a group of Vega 
VI dominants who were hard to 
distinguish from humans if you 
didn’t look closely enough to no- 
tice their complete hairlessness 
and the absence of neck. 

And of course there were the 
inevitable Martians — giant, big- 
chested, spindly-limbed, red-hued 
parodies of humanity; friendly, 
good-natured and alert. But I 
don’t really suppose they should 
be classed among the oddities of 
the place. 

As one of my colleagues com- 
mented in a national publication 
not long ago: “The only place a 
Martian is a novelty any more is 
on Mars.” 

I fully expect the 2080 census 
to show a Martian population on 
Earth more than double that of 
the home planet. So far, the Mar- 
tians seem to be the only extra- 
terrestrials who’ve really taken 
root here. And that’s a problem, 
too. 

But how the hell did I get off 
on that?

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I was finishing my second mar- 
tini, sitting in a booth with my 
feet propped on the seat opposite 
me and catching snatches of a 
conversation between an Earth 
girl and a Vega VI Romeo at a 
nearby table. It was pretty un- 
savory conversation, and I guess 
I was shaking my head sternly 
when a shadow fell over me. 

“Another of the same,” I said, 
looking up' — but it wasn’t the 
waiter. 

It was an enormous, red- 
skinned, balloon-chested, white- 
togaed Martian, and his little 
wrinkled face was smiling like I 
was long-lost Uncle Eddie whom 



he hadn’t seen for forty years. 
When he threw open his long, 
spindly arms and screeched a 
loud, “Ahh!” I was beginning to 
think maybe I was. 

"Mr. Langston!” he shrilled. 
"How gladly to see you! Where 
been? We missing you colossal!” 
Then he slapped one fragile hand 
against his protruding chest, 
looked up at the ceiling and 
squeaked: “Clean living and 

Suns-Rays Incorporated!” He 
looked at me again, smiling. 

“Huh?” I said. "Oh, yeah. Sure 
as hell. Clean living and Suns- 
Rays etcetera. Damn right. Pull 
up a chair, Blek, old boy.” 

A S FAR as I’m concerned, one 
Martian looks pretty much 
like another: but now I recog- 
nized this one. There was only 
one extraterrestrial in the little 
screwball health-cult with which 
I had become rather loosely ac- 
quainted in the past two weeks, 
and this was him. 

I moved my feet and Zan Matl 
Blekeke sat down, exuding sun- 
shine and clean living all over 
the place. We ordered drinks. He 
was elated as blazes about some- 
thing, and I decided I might as 
well let him tell me about it — 
and knowing the typical Mar- 
tian’s haphazard use of the Eng- 
lish language, I regarded the 
prospect as something of a chal- 
lenge. 



Zan Blekeke started right in 
telling me about it in his shrill, 
piping tones: 

“Ah, Mr. Langston, wrong time 
go. Where been? Should have 
been meeting. I derelicted resi- 
dent. Ha! Expected, yups?” 

I replied, "Nups. Let’s start 
over again. Something pretty 
damn important?” 

He nodded. 

"SRI meeting? Yesterday?” 

He nodded again, smiling to 
beat hell. 

I thought for a moment, then 
tried a shot in the dark, illogical 
as it was. “You lost your home? 
Derelicted resident?” 

He looked like I’d stepped on 
his sore corn. 

I tried again. “You don't mean 
you were kicked out of the 
group?” 

He winced. “Oohhh, nooo! Op- 
position. Opposition.” 

“You mean there was too much 
opposition to your being kicked 
out, so you weren’t?” 

He slumped in his seat and re- 
garded me balefully. With the 
pathos of a squeaky hinge, he 
said: 

“Head man. Top dog. Dere- 
licted resident. Boss. Wheel. Me. 
Zan Blekeke.” 

And if I didn’t get it now, I 
just didn’t deserve to know. But 
I got it. 

“You were elected president?” 
I said. 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Zan Blekeke nodded grateful- 
ly. “Yus and so. Undeserving 
awful, but . ." He heaved his 
chest in resignation. 

“No. Not at all,” I protested. 
“Why, I think that’s wonderful. 
You’re just the man for the job! 
Have another drink.” 

W E ordered more drinks, and 
the Martian continued: 
“Membership obviousless that 
whatsoever I closest intimute of 
Dear Late Doctor — ” here he 
raised his eyes again and clapped 
a hand to his chest before he 
finished — “I should wallow in 
step-tracks.” 

“Why, absolutely,” I agreed 
emphatically. “No question about 
it." 

From talking to some of the 
SRI members after meetings or 
at beach sessions, I had gained 
the definite impression that Zan 
Blekeke had been a sort of a 
servant to “Dear Late Doctor," 
and would continue to be a serv- 
ant to whoever was elected in his 
place. 

But instead, they had elected 
the Martian himself. Logical, in 
a cockeyed way. 

This was the first time I’d ever 
really talked to him. I’d seen him 
at the few meetings of SRI I had 
attended, but he had seemed 
pretty quiet there, letting others 
do most of the talking. He was 
in charge of administering the 



daily Sun-Ray treatments, which 
I had taken once or twice my- 
self just for the experience: but 
on those occasions, he had been 
very cold and professional. 

Closest intimute of Dear Late 
Doctor . 

I had never been able to find 
out much about the Doctor. He 
was too sacred a subject for any 
of the members to even talk 
about. Of course, I hadn’t tried 
very hard, because I wasn’t es- 
pecially interested in this assign- 
ment — I was supposed to be on 
vacation. 

Now that a successor had been 
chosen, I wondered if the show 
was over and everyone could go 
home. I asked Blekeke about it. 

"Not while yet,” he replied. 
“Colonial could be. All live one. 
Dear Late Doctor — ” hand to 
heart, face to Heaven, Amen — 
“often told wanted colossal.” 

It wasn’t too clear, but I nod- 
ded anyway. Frankly, my inter- 
est in the whole thing was at a 
very low ebb. With the drinks 
and the effort of untangling 
Blekeke’s twisted English, I was 
becoming listless and sleepy. 

But he insisted on knowing 
where I had been when the meet- 
ing was held. I told him I'd had 
to hurry back to New York for 
a conference with my publisher. 

He said, “Ah, yes. Writer.” He 
pointed to the defense mech on 
the seat beside me. “That typer?” 



THE TELENIZER

“Huh? Oh, no . that’s a 
portable radio. Carry it around 
with me, in case the conversation 
gets dull.” I was at the point 
where I didn’t care much what 
I said. 

He must have taken it as a 
gentle hint, because in a little 
while he got up and left, shrill- 
ing: “fco gladly seeing you. 

Wanted know.” 

I nodded and waved a limp 
hand at him. 

AS I was passing the desk on 
the way up to my room, the 
clerk called, “Mr. Langston, Mr. 
Langston. Long distance call for 
you, sir. I was just ringing your 
room. You can take it in a booth 
there, if you wish, sir.” 

I nodded and walked to the 
row of vp booths. Closing the 
door, I sat down in front of the 
screen and picked up the mike. 
The visiphone screen lighted and 
the speaker crackled. The chubby 
face and shoulders of Carson 
Newell took form and floated on 
the plate. 

“Wanted to be sure you got 
the latest dope on Grogan before 
you see him,” Newell said. “Just 
now got the report.” 

“Go ahead,” I said. 

“Well, then — ” The boss looked 
up from his note pad. “About 
how long had the telenosis been 
on ypu? How many days?” 

“H’m. Don’t know. It’s hard 



to tell, if it’s handled right. Weird 
nightmares, daydreams, absent- 
mindedness, sudden impulses, op- 
tical illusions — it can be telenosis, 
and it can be just you. I’d say 
three or four days, but — ” 

“Wouldn’t necessarily prove 
anything, anyway,” Newell broke 
in. “Here’s the report on Grogan. 
Been out of Corrective for a little 
more than a month now. Went 
directly to Memphis. Cleared up 
business affairs there, then went 
to Palm Beach for vacation. Ar- 
rived late Tuesday afternoon — 
four days ago. Took a suite in 
Space Verge hotel with four quote 
secretaries unquote, and has re- 
fused to see anyone. No unusually 
large baggage. No unusual activi- 
ties reported. So much for that.” 
He turned a page of the note 
pad and went on: “Corrective 
Institute record: responded favor- 
ably to treatment. Occupational 
training in administrative ac- 
counting. Special courses in busi- 
ness and political ethics. Now 
get this — it’s the one thing that 
gives your hunch any credibility 
at all. Three months intermittent 
telenosis therapy for slight para- 
noiac tendencies. Response favor- 
able. Dismissed from C.I. after 
five years, three weeks and six 
days. Classification: Apparent 

cure, but possibility of relapse.” 
We were both quiet for a while, 
looking at each other. 

Then I said, “Well, I’ll see him 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tomorrow. Remember, it’s noth- 
ing but a hunch — not' even that.” 

‘‘Be careful, dammit,” Newell 
cautioned. 

... I woke up sometime in 
the early morning, before it was 
light, with a clicking noise in 
my ears. I lay there in bed, gaz- 
ing into the darkness, wondering, 
yet knowing, what would happen 
if the defense mech should break 
down — if a tube should give out, 
or if some little coil should prove 
defective. 

The clicking stopped after 
a while, but it was a long time be- 
fore I got back to sleep. 

T HAD no trouble getting an 
interview with Grogan. I’d 
known I wouldn’t. It was a sim- 
ple matter of calling his suite 
and telling the loose-mouthed, 
scar-cheeked “secretary” who an- 
swered that Earl Langston would 
like to make an appointment with 
Isaac Grogan for, say, 10:30. 

“Grogan ain’t seein’ nobody,” 
the secretary growled. 

“Ask him,” I said. 

The face vanished and reap- 
peared on the screen a few mo- 
ments later. “Okay. Come up 
anytime you’re ready.” 

“Fifteen minutes,” I said, and 
replaced the mike. 

I turned up the volume of the 
defense mech as high as it would 
go, and left it in my room when I 
left. 



The same hideous secretary, 
with the loose jowels and the 
deep, livid scar on his right cheek, 
met me at the door of Grogan’s 
suite 

“Th’ boss’ll see you in th’ 
library,” the bodyguard rumbled, 
and led me to the room. The 
door closed, but did not click be- 
hind me. 

Isaac Grogan was slouched on 
a sofa, hands in his pockets, 
looking at the floor. 

I stood for a moment, looking 
at him. 

He had changed only a little 
in five years. He was a big man 
with a broad, pleasant face and 
thick black hair. A deep dimple 
divided his chin. The last time 
I’d seen him, he had been getting 
a little paunchy, and there had 
been wrinkles developing in his 
neck and bags under his eyes. 
But that had been from strain 
and worry, and he looked a lot 
better now. 

“You’re looking well,” I told 
him. 

“What the hell do you want?” 
Grogan said quietly. “Why can’t 
you leave me alone? I don’t want 
any trouble.” 

“Neither do I.” 

And suddenly I felt very awk- 
ward. What the hell did I want? 
Just exactly what had I expected 
to accomplish with this visit? I 
didn’t really know. 

I cleared my throat. “I’ve got 



THE TELENIZER

one question, Grogan. Maybe 
two. Then I’ll leave.” 

He looked at me. 

“Do you still blame me for 
what happened in Memphis?” I 
asked. 

Grogan shifted his position and 
gave a sort of half-laugh. “Lang- 
ston, I’ve never liked you, and I 
don’t now. But I can’t say that 
I blame you for the Memphis 
mess — if I ever did. Now, what’s 
your other question?” 

“Telenosis,” I said. 

He waited, looking straight at 
me. “Well? What about it?” 

“According to your C.I. rec- 
ord,” I said, “you had three 
months of intermittent telenosis 
therapy.” 

He shruggged. “That’s right. 
Lots of people do. You still 
haven’t asked your question.” 

“Yes, I have,” I replied. “I'll 
leave now. Thanks for your 
time.” 

FT^HE gorilla-secretary was op- 
-*• ening the front door for me, 
when Grogan spoke again. “Lang- 
ston.” 

I turned around. 

Grogan was standing in the 
door of the library. 

“Langston,” he repeated. “I 
don’t know what your angle is. 
I don’t know why you came 
here, or whether you got what 
you wanted. Furthermore, I 
don’t care much. Five years ago 



is not today, Langston. I’ve 
changed. Just the same, I don’t 
believe I want to see you again. 
I don’t like you. Okay?” 

I said, “Okay,” and left. 

Back in my hotel room, I first 
turned down the volume of the 
defense mech, then sat down at 
the visiphone and put in a call 
to New York. The pudgy image 
of Carson Newell appeared. 

“I’m stumped,” I told him. 
“What’s the matter? Did you 
see Grogan?” 

“Yeah. Just now.” 

“Well?” 

“Nothing. I’m stumped. He’s 
completely changed. If there was 
ever a case of full and complete 
correction, I’d say Grogan is it.” 
Newell tapped his fingertips 
together, then shrugged impa- 
tiently. “Well, hell, I don’t think 
we’re getting anywhere on this. 
I’ll turn it over to the C.I.D. 
and let them worry about it.” 
“So what happens now?” I 
asked. “What am I supposed to 
do?” 

“Take a vacation. But hang on 
to that defense mech. Stay in 
Palm Beach and contact me 
pronto if anything happens. Buzz 
me at least once a day, even if 
anything doesn’t happen.” 

He started to put down the 
mike, then lifted it again. “How’s 
the SRI?” 

“Oh, that. I’ll whip out a story 
on it in a couple of days.” 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“No hurry. Find out all you 
can about it. Give you some- 
thing to do while you’re waiting 
around.” 

He put down the mike and 
faded from the screen. 

S O I promptly did my damned- 
est to forget all about Isaac 
Grogan and telenosis. I spent the 
rest of the day at the beach, 
sprawled out on the hot sand 
with the defense mech beside me 
and an army of people — humans 
and aliens — surrounding me. Only 
once, at about four o’clock, did 
the defense mech start going 
click-click-click. I timed it. It 
lasted three minutes and then 
quit. 

When I got back to the hotel, 
at about five, a man fell into 
step with me as soon as I entered 
the lobby. 

“Name's Maxwell,” he told me. 
“C.I.D. I’m one of your body- 
guards for a while.” 

“How many others do I rate?” 
I asked. 

He was a tall, heavily built 
young man in his middle twenties. 
He carried a briefcase. We head- 
ed for the elevator. 

“Only one,” he replied, “but 
he’ll stay pretty much out of 
sight. He’ll join us in your room 
after a while. We have to ask 
you a lot of questions.” 

The other bodyguard, who 
slipped into my room without 



knocking twenty minutes later, 
was shorter, thinner and older. 
He was bald except for a gray 
fringe, and his name was John- 
son. 

The C.I.D. men spent a half- 
hour checking for hidden mikes 
and cameras before they said 
much of anything. Then they 
plopped down on the edge of the 
bed, and the young man opened 
his briefcase. 

The older one said, “Have your 
dinner sent up here. We'll get 
started on some of these ques- 
tions right away.” 

The questions were both ex- 
haustive and exhausting. The 
older man, Johnson, fired the 
questions, and Maxwell wrote 
down the answers, occasionally 
inserting an inquiry of his own. 
They wanted to know everything 
— not only about my telenosis 
experiences and my knowledge 
of and contacts with Isaac Gro- 
gan, but everything I had done, 
said or thought during the past 
two weeks, everyone I had met 
and talked to, and everything we 
had talked about. 

At the end of three and a half 
hours, I felt completely pumped 
out, and Maxwell had a sheaf of 
notes the size of a best-seller. 

Johnson said, “Well, I guess 
that’ll do for a starter. We’ll have 
another session tomorrow.” 

He took the notes from Max- 
well and put them in Maxwell’s 



THE TELENIZER 



21 



briefcase. He stood up. “I’ll have 
these transcribed and maybe 
check around a little. I’ll meet 
you here at six-thirty tomorrow 
night.” 

“What about — ” I started. He 
cut me off : “Maxwell will stay 
with you. He’s not to let you out 
of his sight. In case anyone asks, 
he’s your brother-in-law from 
Sacramento.” 

¥ COULDN’T help laughing — 

but it was an admiring laugh. 
“You fellows are nothing if not 
thorough. Does my real brother- 
in-law, John Maxwell of Sacra- 
mento, know about this?” I was 
curious. 

It was Maxwell who answered. 
“Your brother-in-law received a 
long-distance emergency call from 
you at noon today, telling him to 
join you immediately. Vision- 
reception was fuzzy, but he rec- 
ognized your voice and took the 
first strato. I changed places with 
him in Denver, where I happened 
to be stationed, and he was smug- 
gled back home. He’s with his 
family, but he’ll have to stay in 
for a few days.” 

I shook my head. “It’s mar- 
velous. Thoroughness personi- 
fied. Say, I’ll bet you fellows 
even thought of getting defense 
mechanisms . but where are 
they?” 

Johnson and Maxwell looked 
at each other, jaws hanging. 



“Well, I’ll be damned!” John- 
son said bitterly. “Thoroughness 
personified! Son of a . .” He 
slapped his hat on his bald head 
and dashed out the door without 
looking back. 

Maxwell grimaced. He got up 
from the bed and walked to an 
easy chair and sat down again. 
“Well, Irvin Johnson will take 
care of that little detail. But it’s 
going to take time . .” 

“It would have taken time 
anyway — a day or so — even if 
you’d thought of it first thing,” 
I said. “Besides, there’s no danger 
until they find your wave-band, 
and that takes time, too.” 

But he remained disconsolate. 
Not because of the danger, but 
simply because they’d overlooked 
an angle. Under a system in 
which the agents are given maxi- 
mum responsibility for details 
and planning, that would count 
heavily against them on their 
records. I almost felt guilty for 
reminding them. 

I said, “John, look — if all else 
fails, there’s one sure quick de- 
fense. Alcohol. I would say that 
under the circumstances, since 
you’re supposed to be protecting 
me, we should keep you as well 
defended as possible.” 

“M’m?” 

“You do drink, don’t you?” I 
asked. 

“Like a fish,” Maxwell said, 
lunging to his feet. 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



TIT 7 HEN we were back in the 
room, Maxwell said: “Hell, 
I don’t see that telenoshis is such 
a damn menash to society, if all 
you have to do is get drunk.” 

“You want a nation of alco- 
holics?” I said. I sat down on the 
bed and untied my shoes. “Any- 
way, whasha difference? D. T. 
horrors or ’noshis horrors? Whash 
worse?" 

Maxwell grunted. 

We both had to sleep in the 
same bed, and Maxwell was a 
restless sleeper. I had finally crept 
into the lower depths of slumber, 
where it was warm and snug, 
when he poked me sharply in the 
ribs. 

“What’s that?” he demanded. 
He was sitting up. 

“What’s what?” 

“Listen!” 

I heard it. Click-click-click . 

“What time is it?” I asked. My 
eyes were still closed, and I was 
damned if I was going to open 
them. 

“Three fifty-seven. But what 
is — ” 

“Defense mech," I said. “Right 
on time. Every twelve hours. 
Tries to get me. Now go sleep.” 

I rolled over and shut my eyes 
even tighter — but I couldn’t get 
all the way back to sleep. Not 
back down to the warm, dark 
depths. It was a long time be- 
fore Maxwell even lay back 
down, and he rolled and twisted 



for the rest of the night. At six 
o’clock, he fell into a deep, quiet 
slumber, and I was wide awake, 
damn him. So I got up and 
dressed. 

I found a news magazine I 
hadn’t read, and occupied my- 
self with it for an hour. Practi- 
cally the entire issue was devoted 
to an analysis of the Martian 
immigration. 

It went way back into history 
and discussed the folklore fear 
that humans had for centuries 
about a Martian invasion. And it 
pointed out that something very 
like a Martian invasion was tak- 
ing place right now. One parti- 
cular article concluded with 
what I considered an unnecessar- 
ily grim warning that unless 
something were done soon to 
check the flow of immigrants, 
Earth would soon be overrun 
with Martians. 

Other articles in the magazine 
went into the causes and impli- 
cations of the migration. One of 
the writers pointed out that Mars 
is a dying planet. In only a few 
thousand years, it will be too 
cold, too dry and too airless to 
support life. 

The development of interplan- 
etary travel a century earlier had 
provided the inhabitants with a 
means of escape. They could 
survive on Earth; now they could 
get to Earth; so they came to 
Earth. 



THE TELENIZER 



23 



One full article was devoted 
to the debates and pending legis- 
lation in World Council on the 
subject, but I didn’t take the 
time to read it. I was fairly fami- 
liar with the current controversy, 
having followed the daily news 
reports, and besides, the reading 
was giving me a headache. 

A T seven o’clock, I considered 
going down for breakfast, 
but it occurred to me that it 
would be another black mark 
against Maxwell if I should be 
seen without him. Forgetting 
about the defense mech was 
enough for one case. 

So I ordered breakfast brought 
up to the room. While I was 
waiting, and since I was sitting 
near it anyway, I flicked the TV 
switch and tuned in ori the morn- 
ing’s news. Nothing earthshak- 
ing: a factory explosion in St. 
Louis: political unrest in India: 
death of a Vegan millionaire; 
speech in The World Council by 
Delegate Machavowski of Eur- 
asia in support of the Bagley- 
Dalton bill to establish a yearly 
immigration quota of ten thou- 
sand from all planets, one thou- 
sand from Mars; protest reply by 
a Martian sociologist at Yale; 
spacecruiser crashed on Calypso, 
twenty killed. And so on and so 
on. 

My attention was held mo- 
mentarily by the Martian ques- 



tion, since I was freshly informed 
on it. 

While the two views of the 
issue did nothing to settle it in 
my mind, they did serve to re- 
mind me of my Martian friend, 
Zan Matl Blekeke, and the fact 
that I was supposed to be dig- 
ging up a feature story on Suns- 
Rays Incorporated. 

“What’s on the agenda for 
today?” my pseudo- brother-in- 
law asked as I was finishing my 
coffee a half-hour later. He rolled 
out of bed, yawned and scratch- 
ed his head vigorously. His hair 
was rumpled, but he looked rest- 
ed, and I envied him to beat 
hell. 

“You mean it’s up to me?” I 
asked. \ 

“Sure. You just go on with 
your normal everyday existence 
and ignore me, like I’m nothing 
but a shadow.” He was still 
stretching laiily. 

“Well, for the first thing, I’m 
going to see that we get a cot 
in here. There isn’t room in that 
bed for both of us.” 

Maxwell grinned as he button- 
ed his shirt. “D’l kick you out of 
bed? Sorry. Should have warned 
you.” 

“Do you eat breakfast?” I 
asked him. 

“Hell, ye&. Like a wolf.” 

“Well, l^t’s go down and get 
you some breakfast while I figure 
out my agenda for today.”

T WASN’T sure what I wanted 
•*- to do — start working on that 
SRI feature, I supposed, so I 
could get it out of the way and 
either relax or concentrate on 
this telenosis business, which I 
was supposed to be forgetting 
about. I had most of the dope I 
needed for the story — atmos- 
phere, first hand experience. 

Everything, it occurred to me, 
but the essential facts. 

For instance, I would need to 
know more about Zan Blekeke 
himself — simple biographical 
data that shouldn’t take too long 
to gather. A harder job would be 
finding out about “Dear Late 
Doctor.” So far I didn’t even 
know what his name was. And 
if none of the SRI members 
would talk about him. 

As Maxwell and I sat at a 
breakfast room table, I made a 
mental checklist of the points 
I would have to work on. I was 
staring out the window at the 
flowers staging a color-riot in the 
garden, when suddenly Maxwell 
said: 

“Say, Earl, about how long 
does it take to find out a guy’s 
brain wave band?” 

“Huh? What do you mean?” I 
looked at him. He was shoveling 
pancakes into his mouth like a 
fireman stoking a furnace. 

He shrugged and swallowed. 
“You said there was no danger 
from telenosis until they found 



my wave band. Well, last night I 
had the damnedest nightmares, 
and I was just wondering — ” 

“Relax,” I said. “Ever been 
telenized?” 

“Not that I know of.” 

"Got nothin’ to worry about, 
then. If you had been telenized, 
it’s just possible they could have 
gotten your band number from 
the Telenosis Bureau. Which, by 
God, come to think of it, is 
where they probably got mine. 
But without that, or an electro- 
encaphalograph, it’d take weeks, 
at least.” 

“But can’t it influence a lot 
of people at once? I mean, like 
mass hypnosis?” 

“Sure be hell if it could,” I 
said. “But I don’t think it can. 
I don’t know why not, but I 
definitely remember old Doc 
Reighardt saying it’d never been 
done.” 

He seemed to feel better. He 
finished his breakfast in relative 
silence. I was able to map out 
a general procedure for gathering 
all of the necessary SRI informa- 
tion. 

First step was to get hold of 
Zan Blekeke again and have him 
tell me his life history. I shud- 
dered at the prospect, but it 
had to be done. 

“We’re going to East Emerson 
beach,” I told John Maxwell. 

On the way, aboard a third- 
level bus, I asked him, “SRI 



THE TELENIZER

ever been investigated by you 
people?” 

“Damn if I know. Why?” 

“Never mind. Save me a lot 
of trouble, maybe, if it had. Just 
a thought." 

We found the SRI cultists at 
their usual place on the beach. 
It was a stretch on the far south 
end, a rough, gravelly portion 
quite a bit beyond the army of 
regular bathers. 

As we approached, threading 
our way through the maze of um- 
brellas, tablecloths and people, 
people, people in practically all 
stages of nudity, I noticed that 
a makeshift rope fence enclosed 
the little group of SR Is where 
they were sprawled out doing 
their relaxing exercises. That was 
something new — the fence, I 
mean. 

I started to crawl through the 
ropes, and one of the nearby 
recliners jumped to his feet, stood 
in front of me and made pushing 
motions with his hands. 

“I’m sorry, sirs, but this is a 
meeting of The Suns-Rays In- 
corporated religious group. You 
are requested not to enter.” 

Now, he knew better than to 
say a silly thing like that to me. 
His name was Monte Bingham, 
and he knew damn well who I 
was, and I told him so. “I’m 
practically an ex-officio member 
in good standing myself,” I said. 
“Wake up, you goof.” 



Monte Bingham turned slowly 
around and looked toward the 
big Martian, Zan Blekeke, who 
was sitting up with his spindly 
legs outstretched near the center 
of the enclosure. 

Blekeke got to his feet and 
waddled toward us, waving Bing- 
ham aside. He was not smiling. 
He stood glaring at us. 

“Whose?” he said with a swift, 
half-gesture toward Maxwell. 

“Whose?” I repeated. “He’s 
mine. I mean, he’s my brother- 
in-law, John Maxwell, come to 
visit me from Sacramento. He’s 
okay. What’s going on? I just 
wanted to make an appointment 
to talk with you.” 

Blekeke heaved his big round 
bare chest. “Trying still disciple 
in,” he replied. 

“How’s that? Discipline, you 
mean?" 

“Yups. Laters out. Strangers 
out. No excepting. Can’t.” 

“Yeah, but you know me. and 
John here — ” 

“Brother law oaks, but both 
laters. See hall hour halfish. Talk 
then. Treatment, yups?” 

I said, “Well, I guess that’ll be 
okay. Hour and a half, at the 
hall, huh?” 

Blekeke said, “Yups,” and 
turned away. 

TIE took two steps and stop- 
ped. I saw his spine stiffen. 
His head turned slowly toward 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the water’s edge where two dogs 
'•5ere running circles around each 
other, not far from the enclosure. 
As the dogs moved, Blekeke’s 
head moved with them, back and 
forth and back again. 

Suddenly one of the dogs, the 
smaller one — a black and white 
spaniel with flapping ears — turn- 
ed and raced through the SRI 
compound, bounding gracelessly 
over the sprawled bodies of SRI 
members. The larger German 
shepherd gave two woofs and 
leaped playfully in pursuit. They 
passed within about ten feet of 
Blekeke. 

When the German shepherd 
barked, I heard a thin, drawn- 
out squeak, like a mouse with his 
tail caught in a trap, come from 
Blekeke. He turned around with 
incredible speed and took a half- 
step in our direction. His face 
was distorted as though in pain, 
and for an instant I thought he 
had stepped on a jagged piece of 
glass or something. 

But then I recognized the ex- 
pression on his face. It was not 
pain. 

It was terror. 

I noticed now that he was 
trembling violently. He twirled 
again and started in the opposite 
direction, stopped and turned 
swiftly around once more. He 
acted as though he were sur- 
rounded on all sides by invisible 
Martian-eaters. 



The dogs paused at the edge 
of the enclosure for a moment to 
stand on their hind legs and ex- 
change playful blows; then they 
raced off together toward the 
more densely populated beach 
area. 

Blekeke’s face suddenly relax- 
ed, and with a final shudder he 
controlled the trembling. 

He was muttering: “Doggie, 
doggie, doggie',” when he lowered 
his eyes to us, and he gave a 
little start as if he hadn’t known 
we were standing there. 

“Hall. Hour halfish,” he said 
after a moment’s pause. Then he 
turned and walked rapidly back 
into the midst of the prostrate 
SRI members and lay down. 

Maxwell and I exchanged 
glances and walked away. I felt, 
all of a sudden, rather sad and 
depressed. When we had gone a 
respectable distance, I said, 
“Poor devil! Fear of dogs. It 
must be awful.” 

“Fear of dogs? Cynophobia? 
You think that’s what it was?” 
“Well, sure,” I replied. “Only 
thing it could be.” 

Maxwell said, “First case I’ve 
ever seen of it.” 

“Me, too.” 

TT was still not quite ten 
o’clock. We killed the next 
hour and a half basking in the 
Sun and taking occasional dips 
in the water. We had to go one

at a time, because one of us 
had to stay and guard the de- 
fense mech. 

At 11:30 we kept our appoint- 
ment with Blekeke. He was alone 
in the SRI hall, a long, low, 
metal building located a half- 
mile down the beach from the 
general bathing area. 

HPHE hall had once been a stor- 
age warehouse of some kind 
— I have no idea what kind. But 
that had been a long time ago; 
and it was now used exclusively 
for SRI meetings. 

There was another building 
near it, the ramshackle, rambling 
mansion of a long-dead million- 
aire, which had been appropri- 
ated by the SRI as housing 
quarters for the members who 
did not care to stay in rooms or 
hotels in town. And most of them 
didn’t. 

Maxwell was interested in the 
house, but I couldn’t tell him 
anything about it. I had never 
been in it, whereas I had been 
in the hall several times. Of 
course, there was nothing much 
to explain about the hall — it 
was practically bare. 

The Sun Ray stood like an al- 
tar at one end. About thirty-five 
folding chairs were lined up in 
rows facing the Ray. That was 
all. 

Blekeke was doing something 
to the lamp part of the Ray when 



we came in — tightening the bulb, 
apparently. It was a very simple 
contraption. Nothing but a pad- 
ded, white-sheeted reclining table 
suspended over the full length 
of which was the lamp. The thing 
was operated by a bank of con- 
trols wired up a few feet away 
from the table. 

“Infra-red heat lamp,’’ Max- 
well whispered. 

“Sure,” I said. “But don’t say 
so.” 

Blekeke saw us and jumped 
down from the platform and 
greeted us with open arms, apol- 
ogizing for his rude behavior on 
the beach. 

I told him to forget about it; 
that I just wanted to ask him a 
few questions so I could write 
up my story about SRI — give 
him a little free publicity. 

Blekeke beamed. Said he’d 
be glad to help all he could. 

But before I had a chance to 
ask any questions, he was blab- 
bering: “Give treatment. New, 
improve. Much healthier. Give 
try.” And he was pushing us 
toward the machine. 

I was not the least bit inter- 
ested in taking a treatment, and 
I tried to tell him so, as kindly 
as I could. But he was insistent. 

Finally we agreed to take the 
treatment, hoping he would get 
it out of his system. I handed the 
defense mech to Maxwell and 
lay down. Couldn’t tell a damn 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bit of difference. Ten minutes of 
warmth and dozy relaxation, and 
that’s it. You don’t feel a bit 
different after it’s over than you 
did before. 

Unless you’re a good cultist, 
and convince yourself by auto- 
suggestion that all your bodily 
ills have been miraculously — if 
temporarily — baked out. 

After Maxwell had been given 
the treatment, I tried again to 
get Blekeke pinned down to an- 
swering some of my questions, 
but it was no good. 

He was obliging, cooperative 
and friendly as hell, but his 
heart just wasn’t in it. He had 
to tell us about the improve- 
ments in the Ray, and when I 
threw specific questions at him, 
he always managed to answer 
with some reference to the Ray 
and start all over again — and it 
was all pure gibberish. 

I gave up. We parted with 
mutual benedictions, and John 
Maxwell and I walked away, to- 
ward the one-track road leading 
to the old mansion. 

“What do you do in a situa- 
tion like this?” I asked him. 

He shrugged. “Try somebody 
else.” 

We walked up the front steps 
of the mansion, and I punched 
the doorbell. 

It was no go there, either. 
The cultist who opened the door, 
whom I remembered as a shoe 



salesman from Boise, informed 
us firmly and none too politely 
that no one could enter without 
the explicit and written permis- 
sion of President Matl Blekeke 
He showed no sign of recogniz- 
ing me. He slammed the door. 

I gave emphatic utterance to 
an unprintable word and said, 
“Let’s go back to town.” 

J OHNSON showed up in the 
room promptly at six-thirty, 
as he had promised, again slip- 
ping in without knocking. He 
threw his briefcase and his hat 
on the bed and pulled up a chair 
to the cardtable where Maxwell 
and I were playing chess. 

“How about the defense 
mechs?” Maxwell asked. 

“Hospital in New York is 
working on ’em,” Johnson said. 
“Promised they’d have ’em ready 
tomorrow morning. I’m going up 
tonight, after I get through here, 
so I can pick ’em up right away.” 
“Quick work,” I said. 

“Any new developments on this 
end? I’ve been too busy today 
getting things organized to keep 
an eye on you.” 

“Every twelve hours Langs- 
ton’s defense mech starts click- 
ing,” Maxwell said. “Four 
o’clock this morning and four 
o’clock this afternoon.” 

“So he’s not giving up on you, 
anyway,” Johnson said. “We 
know he’s still around. What 



THE TELENIZER 



29 



else? Anything new come up?” 
I shrugged. “Spent the whole 
day on a wild goose chase — from 
my point of view. Trying to dig 
up information for my feature 
about Suns-Rays Incorporated.” 
Johnson nodded. “No luck, 
huh?” 

I told him about the so-called 
interview with Blekeke that 
morning, and how in the after- 
noon I had tried to contact those 
SRI members who I knew had 
been living in town. That had 
been futile, too; all of them had 
moved to the house on the beach. 
Then Maxwell and I had spent a 
couple of hours in the library, 
checking reference books for 
some mention of SRI or any of 
its members. With no results. 

Johnson recognized the frus- 
tration in my voice. “Don’t let 
it get you down,” he said. 

I asked him if the C.I.D. had 
ever investigated the cult. 

“Not yet,” he said. “Not that I 
know of. But everyone that 
you’ve had any contact with 
since you’ve been here is being 
checked thoroughly. And since 
that includes the SRI cult, it’ll 
get a very complete going-over.” 
I said, “Well, shucks, then. All 
I have to do is sit back and let 
you fellows dig up the informa- 
tion I need.” 

“That, of course, depends on 
how the information is classified 
after it’s processed,” Johnson 



corrected. “Maybe you can use 
it and maybe you can’t.” He 
shrugged. “Well, I’ve got a whole 
new batch of questions here for 
you. That’s my job right now. 
Let’s get at ’em.” 

A FTER Johnson was gone and 
I again felt mentally empty, 
I turned to Maxwell, who was 
pacing the floor restlessly: “Well, 
shall we go down and set up 
your defense barrier again?” 
“Let’s take a walk,” he said. 
“I’ve got a headache. Fresh air 
might help.” 

“Suits me,” I replied. “I know 
of a little bar seven or eight 
blocks from here . .” 

I stopped because he was al- 
ready going out the door, and I 
had to get up from the chair, 
grab the defense mech and run 
after him. 

He wasn’t hurrying, just walk- 
ing casually, but not waiting for 
anything. 

In the elevator, on the way 
down, he said, “Those defense 
mechs. God damn. I wish those 
defense mechs . .” 

I nudged him. The elevator 
operator was looking at him 
closely, and there’s no use tak- 
ing any chances. He ought to 
know better. 

He was out of the elevator as 
soon as the door opened at 
ground level. He walked toward 
the front entrance. I had to run 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



again to catch up with him. 

“Hey. what’s the hurry?” I 
asked. “Can I come along too?” 

He didn’t answer, just kept 
walking. Looking straight ahead, 
still not hurrying, but moving 
rapidly nevertheless. When we 
got outside, he turned right and 
continued at the same steady 
pace. 

I tugged at his arm. “Hey, the 
bar I mentioned is the other 
way.” 

He shook my hand loose and 
kept walking. “I want to go this 
way.” 

I shrugged and trotted to keep 
up with him. “Okay. If you know 
of a better place, we’ll go there. 
But — ” 

“This damn headache,” he 
said. “I’ve had it all day. All 
afternoon.” 

“My fault,” I said. “I started 
you puzzling over a problem that 
concerns only me. 

He wasn’t listening. 

There were few pedestrians on 
this level of traffic; most people 
who walked places took the am- 
bulators on the second level. 
Down here the sidewalks were 
narrow and the curbs high, the 
streets being used almost exclu- 
sively for heavy transfer and de- 
livery trucks. 

A high metal railing along the 
street-side of the walk prevented 
careless pedestrians from step- 
ping in the path of the huge, 



swift, rumbling vehicles. 

But there were no railings at 
the intersections. 

And at the next intersection. 
Maxwell stepped off the curb, 
shifted his course just a fraction, 
and went on at a tangent that 
would have had him smack in 
the middle of a truck-traffic 
lane. 

T GRABBED his arm and pull- 
ed hard, to get him headed 
back in the right direction. 

“What the hell are you trying 
to do — get yourself killed?” 
Which was almost exactly 
what I’d started to say. But he 
was the one who said it. 

So I just said, “Huh?” 

He jerked his arm free and 
continued walking — straight to- 
ward an oncoming 100-ton semi. 

I had a sudden idea of what 
was going on, and acted rapidly. 

I set the defense mech down, 
because you can’t handle a man 
Maxwell’s size with only one 
hand. I grabbed his arm again, 
this time with both hands, and 
pulled as hard as I could. It 
jerked him off balance and out 
of danger. The semi roared past. 

And Maxwell turned on me 
with sudden, violent anger. 

“Listen,” he snapped, “what in 
hell’s the matter with you? What 
do you think you’re doing?” 

I didn’t argue with him. I 
took careful aim and threw a 



THE TELENIZER

haymaker, giving it everything I 
had. It caught the point of his 
chin squarely and jarred me to 
my ankle. 

He swayed a little bit and his 
face went blank, but he didn’t 
fall. 

For which I shall be eternally 
grateful. 

Another giant semi, still nearly 
a block away, was hurtling to- 
ward us. If Maxwell had fallen, 
I could not possibly have drag- 
ged him out of the way in time. 
And the semi couldn’t have stop- 
ped in that distance. 

As it was, I was able to snatch 
up the defense mech with one 
hand and propel Maxwell to 
the opposite curb, just seconds 
before the truck went by with a 
whiz and a rattle. 

I got Maxwell onto an escala- 
tor leading to the second level 
before his legs buckled. Then he 
went to his knees. I managed to 
get his arm around my shoulder 
and hoist him back to his feet 
before we reached the top. 

On the second level there were 
no vehicles; quite a few pedes- 
trians glided by in both direc- 
tions, on several different speeds 
of ambulator bands. 

I spotted a bar down the street 
and dragged Maxwell onto a am- 
band going that way. 

By the time I got him inside 
and settled in a booth, he was 
beginning to recover, shaking his 



head and muttering to himself. 

I ordered a whole bottle of 
Scotch and handed Maxwell a 
glass of the stuff. He took it 
automatically and (jrank half of 
it as though it were water. 

TTE put the glass down quickly 
and half rose from his seat, 
clutching his throat and gasping. 
I handed him another glass, this 
one containing water. He drank 
it and sat back down, slowly. 

“Drink the rest of that 
Scotch," I said. “Drink it quick 
and don’t ask any questions. 
Someone’s got a telenosis beam 
on you, and he isn’t kidding.” 

It penetrated, for he emptied 
the glass with short but rapid 
gulps. I filled the glass again and 
ordered more water. It took him 
fifteen minutes to kill the glass 
this time, taking only a little sip 
of Scotch for every deep gulp of 
water. But he got it down, 
though he was nearly uncon- 
scious at the end. 

“Listen," I said, reaching over 
to shake his limp shoulder. “Are 
you still with me? For the love 
of heaven, don’t pass out on 
me — that’s about the worst thing 
you could do. John!" 

He jerked his head and regard- 
ed me with unfocused eyes. 
“Huh? Wash matter, ole fren? 
I’m wish ya. Wish ya ta the end. 
Washer trouble, huh?" 

I said, “John, listen. You’re 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in danger. We’ve got to get you 
out of here. Out of town. Back 
to New York. Right away! Do 
you understand?” 

He nodded limply. I wasn’t 
sure whether he really under- 
stood or not. But if he could only 
walk, it wouldn’t make much 
difference. 

If only he didn’t pass out . 
it wasn’t very far. Just back to 
the door, then into the elevator 
instead of going onto the street 
at this level. Then, on the third 
level, only the few feet necessary 
to catch a bus or a cab to take 
us to the strato-port. 

If he couldn’t walk, I didn’t 
know what I’d do. Whoever the 
telenosis operator was, I was 
sure he had followed us to this 
bar through Maxwell’s mind, 
That’s the way telenosis works. 
Alcohol sets up a complete bar- 
rier, and contact is broken en- 
tirely: but about all a blow on 
the head does is immobilize the 
victim — visions, commands and 
other impressions can still pene- 
trate. and the operator can still 
receive whatever sensations his 
victim may have. 

Maxwell hadn’t been uncon- 
scious enough for us to be safe. 
Someone wanted our blood. We 
had to move fast. 

And if he couldn’t manage to 
walk at all . 

He couldn’t, exactly. But he 
could get to his feet and lurch 



and stumble along after a fashion. 

It accomplished the same pur- 
pose. 

T got him to the third level, and 
we stood at -the entrance of 
the bar while I got myself ori- 
ented. 

I had made a tactical error. 
Vehicles going to the strato-port 
stopped on the other side of the 
street. And to get there, I would 
now have to walk Maxwell all 
the way down to the end of the 
block to a pedestrian cross-walk, 
then halfway back up the other 
side. 

The alternative was to go down 
again and cross in the middle of 
the block on the pedestrian level, 
which is what I should have done 
in the first place. 

But I wanted to get as far 
away from the bar as possible 
and as soon as possible. So I 
shrugged and turned to my left, 
shoving and dragging Maxwell 
with me. 

As I did so, my defense mech 
started clicking. 

Maxwell stumbled and nearly 
fell. I shoved him against the 
side of a building and leaned 
against him to keep him up. The 
liquor had hit him hard. If he 
once went down, there would be 
no getting him up. Not by me. 

We did better after I wrapped 
one of his arms around my 
shoulder. I could carry part of 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his weight and I had better con- 
trol of him. I kept him as close 
to the storefronts as possible, to 
minimize the possibility of be- 
ing recognized from a moving 
vehicle in the Street. 

It didn’t do a bit of good. 

They’d probably spotted us as 
soon as we stepped away from 
the bar entrance. For all I know, 
they had been waiting for us 
since we entered the bar. 

Three of them. Sitting there 
in the illegally parked light pas- 
senger sedan just ahead of us. 

I saw it when we were still 
fifteen feet away. I saw it, and I 
knew what it was, and I stopped. 

The sedan wasn’t really park- 
ed. It was just pulled over close 
against the curb, moving slowly 
toward us. 

When I stopped, the sedan 
moved up quickly even with us, 
and two men stepped out. 

I edged Maxwell toward a 
drugstore entrance a few feet to 
the left, but the men from the 
sedan were at our side in an 
instant. 

“Hey, friend, got a match?” 
one of them asked for the benefit 
of a passing couple who glanced 
at us. 

I recognized him. A deep criss- 
crossed scar ran from above his 
right cheekbone vertically down 
his cheek, ending in a big dent in 
his jaw bone. His lips were thick 
and loose. 



TT'OR just an instant I was mo- 
-*• tionless, frozen, my right hand 
holding Maxwell’s arm over my 
shoulder, my left hand gripping 
the quietly ticking defense mech. 

Then I moved almost without 
thinking about it. 

I released my grip on Max- 
well’s arm, shoving him against 
the thug that I didn’t recognize. 
At the same time, I swung my 
defense mech, aiming at the head 
of my scarfaced acquaintance. 
He raised his arm, but the heavy 
case slammed into it and bounc- 
ed off his forehead. 

It probably broke his arm, 
and possibly fractured his skull. 
I didn’t wait to find out. 

Holding tightly to the defense 
mech, I darted into the store 
entrance. I left Maxwell blindly 
clutching the assailant into whose 
path I had thrown him. I didn’t 
worry about Maxwell. They 
could have him. If I got away, 
they wouldn’t dare kill him. And 
if I didn’t get away, they would 
kill both of us. 

The escalator was just inside 
the door to the right, and I ran 
down the downward-moving 
steps, doubling back to the left 
at the bottom, and out the door 
on the pedestrian level. I turned 
left again and ran to the corner, 
crossed the street and ran three- 
fourths the length of the block. 

I glanced backward and 
didn’t see anyone running after 



THE TELENIZER

me, so I entered a late-hour de- 
partment store. I wasn’t safe yet, 
and I didn’t feel safe, but I 
felt encouraged enough to slow 
down to a fast walk through the 
aisles of the men’s clothing sec- 
tion. 

I had to get to a visiphone, 
first of all, and call Newell in 
New York. And then — well, I 
wasn’t sure. Hide, somewhere. 
Keep from being captured. 

It took me three minutes of 
rapid wandering through the 
building to find a row of visi- 
phone booths. I placed the call. 
While I waited, nervously cross- 
ing and uncrossing my legs, peer- 
ing intermittently out the 
window to see if there was any 
sign of pursuit, I had time to 
think. 

I had time to think, but I 
didn’t think. Not really. I was 
thinking of what I was going to 
tell Newell. Thinking of Max- 
well being dragged away by 
Grogan’s “secretaries,” and won- 
dering what would happen to 
him. But I didn’t really think, 
and maybe it’s just as well. 

A little less than nine agoniz- 
ing minutes elapsed before New- 
ell’s plump face appeared on the 
screen. 

“You’re late tonight,” he said. 
“I was just on the verge of call- 
ing you. How’re things going?” 

I told him quickly, and with 
a minimum of detail, what had 



happened since our last session. 

“It’s Grogan, after all,” I said. 
“I’d recognize that scarfaced gor- 
illa of his anywhere. Get Grogan 
and — ” 

The boss nodded. “We’ll get 
him. You let me worry about 
that. You’ve got to . .You say 
they were beaming telenosis on 
Maxwell? How the devil did 
they get his wave-band so soon?” 

“You can worry about that 
one, too,” I told him. 

“Okay. Never mind. Where are 
you now? Never mind that either. 
Just stay there. Call the near- 
est police station and have them 
send someone after you. Get in 
a nice snug cell and stay put. 
We’ll take care of Grogan and 
Maxwell. Okay, now. Don’t 
waste any time.” 

W E hung up together. Then I 
quickly dialed the operator 
and asked for the nearest sec- 
tional police station. 

When the face of the desk 
sergeant flashed on the screen, 
I told him, “My name is Earl 
Langston. My life is in immedi- 
ate danger. I’m in a vp booth 
near the Pacific Street entrance, 
number four, of Underhill’s de- 
partment store, second level.” 
“Stay where you are,” the ser- 
geant replied. “We’ll have some- 
one after you in ten or fifteen 
minutes.” 

In a surprisingly short time, 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an overweight, gray-uniformed 
policeman with a face like a bull- 
dog rapped at the door of the 
booth. 

I stood up and opened the 
door. 

“Earl Langston?” he asked. I 
nodded and followed him to an 
elevator. We went up to the third 
level and then through a maze 
of aisles and departments before 
going out a door that opened on 
a parking lot. 

The policeman led me to an 
unmarked auto and opened the 
back door for me. Two dogs 
barked at my heels as we walked 
to the vehicle. I shooed them off 
before I closed the door. 

I leaned back on the soft 
cushions with a sigh and set the 
heavy defense mech on the edge 
of the seat beside me, still hold- 
ing the handle loosely with one 
hand. 

The motor purred as we mov- 
ed slowly out of the parking lot 
and into the street. 

I paid no attention to where 
we were going. Just breathed an- 
other sigh and closed my eyes. 
At last, I could begin to relax. 
In just a few minutes, now, I’d 
be safe. I hadn’t realized how 
tense I was. My neck muscles 
ached and my stomach slipped 
slowly from my chest cavity back 
down to where it belonged. 

It seemed a long time ago that 
I had abandoned Maxwell to 



Grogan’s thugs . What had 
happened to him since then? 
How long ago had it been? Only 
half an hour? Not much longer, 
anyway. 

Now again I had time to think, 
and this time I did think. I 
began to ask myself questions — 
to wonder about certain things. 

How had Grogan learned 
Maxwell’s wave -band so soon? 

What was Grogan doing with 
a telenizer in the first place, and 
what was he up to? Just personal 
revenge against me? 

How did I know for sure that 
it was Grogan? 

That question startled me. I 
opened my eyes and sat up 
straight. In moving so suddenly, 
my hand knocked over the de- 
fense mech and it thudded to the 
floor. As I bent quickly to pick 
it up, it started clicking again. 

Several things occurred to me 
at once, then, and my stomach 
wadded itself into a tight ball 
and shot up again to press 
against my heart. My neck and 
back muscles tightened. 

T'HE first thing that struck me, 
I think, was that the defense 
mech had started clicking again. 
It had been clicking before. 
As Maxwell and I left the bar, 
the defense mech had begun 
clicking steadily. Then — some- 
time — it had stopped. Probably 
when I hit Scarface with it. But 



THE TELENIZER 



37 



I hadn’t noticed. And for thirty 
minutes — closer to forty-five, 
now . 

There was no particular se- 
quence to the flood of realizations 
that rushed my consciousness 
next and left me feeling weak and 
shaky. 

The desk sergeant had said ten 
minutes. The policeman had got- 
ten there in less than five. We 
were driving, not through side 
streets toward a police station, 
but along a high-speed lane of a 
main thoroughfare, away from 
the city. Two dogs had yapped 
at my heels. The “police” vehicle 
was unmarked — unusual if not 
illegal. 

When I looked at the driver, 
he was not, of course, a police- 
man. 

He was one of Grogan’s body- 
guards — the one into whose arms 
I had thrown Maxwell not long 
ago. 

He was staring straight ahead 
at the road, his spread-nosed 
face composed. He hadn’t no- 
ticed anything. 

I took a deep breath and lean- 
ed back again, half-closing my 
eyes. But I did not relax. The 
clicking of the defense mech 
seemed thunderous to me, but 
if the driver heard it, he gave 
no indication. Perhaps it would 
have meant nothing to him if he 
did hear it. 

I tried to think of the problem 



at hand, but my mind refused to 
cooperate. It kept rushing back 
to events of the recent past and 
demanding reasons and explana- 
tions. 

When the defense mech falter- 
ed and quietly stopped clicking, 
I was aware of it this rime. My 
first impulse was to hit it with 
my hand and try to make it 
work again, but I restrained my- 
self. 

I controlled my thoughts firm- 
ly, holding them tight and shap- 
ing them carefully in my mind 
before letting them go. 

The driver was again a police- 
man in the gray police uniform. 
We were once more driving slow- 
ly through city streets instead 
of speeding along a highway. 
Two dogs ran beside the auto, 
barking — the same two dogs that 
I had shooed before I closed the 
door. 

I formed my thoughts: 1 know 
who you are. It’s no secret any 
more. But why? What are you 
trying to do? 

There was no reply. 

It could mean one of two 
things. Either he simply didn’t 
want to answer, or else he wasn’t 
on the machine in person but was 
playing an impression-tape on 
my wave-band. I tried again. 

You’re licked, you know. Al- 
ready you’re licked. Even if my 
call to Newell was nothing but a 
telenosis dream — even if no one 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



knows anything about this but 
me, you’re still licked — 

IVTO reply. None of any kind. 

^ I’d expected at least to get 
a sinister chuckle, or a flood of 
horrors. But there was nothing 
more nor less than what there 
had been — the policeman driving 
through quiet city streets, and 
the dogs barking. 

Then it was just a recording, 
prepared in advance. My mind 
was not being followed in per- 
son. Not right now. 

But that was no help and no 
assurance. I still didn’t dare get 
out of the car. Or knock the 
driver over the head and take 
over the car myself. At ninety 
miles an hour, and with a visual 
impression of moving slowly 
along city streets, that would be 
a sure form of suicide. 

Or would it? 

Apparently I had no choice 
but to wait until we arrived at 
our destination and then do what 
I could — which might not be 
much. 

Lord, if I could make another 
vp call before we got there! 

Careful, though. Even with no 
operator at the telenizer, I had 
to watch out for thought leakage. 
My thoughts were surely being 
recorded, and certain kinds of 
thoughts might trigger automa- 
tic precautionary measures. 

I gave the defense mech a hard 



bang with my hand. It clicked 
twice. I got a brief glimpse of 
the highway flashing past and 
the lights of other vehicles. 

Then the clicking stopped, and 
we were back in town, crawling 
along. I hit the defense mech 
again, a series of lighter blows, 
and it obediently clicked and this 
time continued clicking; and we 
were on the highway again. 

Making an ‘effort to control 
my breathing and to muffle the 
sound of my rapidly pounding 
heart, I leaned forward and ex- 
amined the controls of the auto 
intently. 

There was a phone. Not a visi- 
phone, of course, but a phone 
nonetheless. A means of com- 
munication* There was also a 
luminous radar dial that might 
or might not mean automatic 
controls. 

Which might or might not be 
in operation. 

I concentrated on the hands 
and feet of the driver. Neither 
moved perceptibly. The course 
of the vehicle was straight and 
constant, though, so that didn’t 
prove anything. 

“Hey, where in hell is this po- 
lice station?” I asked. 

With a slight backward-turn- 
ing motion of his head, the driv- 
er replied, “Almost there. Just 
a few minutes now.” 

As his head moved, his hands 
moved the wheel a bare fraction. 



THE TELENIZER 



39 



The auto did not swerve. 

I took a deep breath and hit 
the driver on the side of the head 
with my doubled right fist as 
hard as I could. He slumped, and 
I hit him again. His hands slid 
from the wheel . and the car 
continued on its course. 

I clambered into the front seat 
with the driver. 

A S I lifted the mike, the auto 
started slowing down, and I 
thought for a moment it wasn’t 
electronically controlled after all. 
That was a horrible moment, and 
I clutched at the wheel instinc- 
tively, but the car still did not 
swerve. 

So I quit worrying about that 
and dialed the number. 

The conversation, once I had 
the call through, took quite a lit- 
tle while. I had to convince the 
man that I was serious. While I 
was talking, arguing frantically, 
the auto was slowing almost to a 
stop, maneuvering over to the 
turning lane on the right, making 
the turn and following a narrow 
road that crossed under the high- 
way. 

The urgency of my voice must 
have been pretty convincing, be- 
cause the voice on the other end 
finally said, "Well, I’ll do what 
I can, Mr. Langston, but it’ll 
take time. Maybe an hour. May- 
be more. And so help me, if this 
is a joke — ” 



"It’s no joke,” I pleaded. "Be- 
lieve me, it isn’t. Please make it 
as fast as you can. Civilization 
may be at stake.” On that deli- 
berately ominous note, I hung up. 

Immediately I began thinking 
of the things I should have done, 
the machinery I should have set 
in motion instead of the one 
thing I had done. By all means, 
I ought to have notified the po- 
lice directly. My notion that tele- 
nosis influenced all the police 
desk sergeants in town was hys- 
terical, baseless. Well, I could 
call back, even now — 

But I couldn’t. 

The car was moving at a rel- 
atively slow speed — but still over 
fifty miles an hour, on a nar- 
row unpaved, downgrade road. 
Through the side window I saw 
dark trees and shadowy brush 
gliding by. 

And then through the window 
I saw lighted storefronts, mail 
boxes, a few vague pedestrians 
on smooth sidewalks, and two 
dogs running tirelessly beside the 
car, barking as they ran . 

Repeated pounding on the 
heavy black box did not restore 
reality. 

Now I did not dare use the 
phone again or even think about 
it. I was sitting beside the driver, 
and the driver was sitting erect 
at the wheel. 

On a sudden, stupid impulse, 
I struck at the driver’s head, and 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



my hand went through it with- 
out touching anything. I groped 
with my hand until I felt the 
man’s limp head where my eyes 
said his shoulder was. 

With a suppressed shudder, I 
drew my hand away and sat back 
in the seat to wait. It couldn’t be 
long now. 

The car turned a comer and 
continued at a much slower pace. 
It went perhaps a hundred yards 
before it pulled to the curb and 
stopped. Across the street I saw 
the police station. The entrance 
looked like any other store or 
business entrance, but a mar- 
quee-sign above the entrance 
read: “Section 4 Police Station.’’ 

The driver sat motionless be- 
hind the wheel. He would not 
move, I knew, until . 

I shrugged, picked up the de- 
fense mech, and opened the door. 

Pedestrians walked by along 
the sidewalk, and autos glided in 
both directions on the street. 
Dogs yapped at my heels. I ig- 
nored them. They did not exist. 

But I knew the police station 
did exist. 

I walked directly toward the 
entrance — a long kitty-corner 
across the street. When a power- 
fully humming auto headed to- 
ward me, I closed my eyes and 
braced myself and continued 
walking. 

It is not a pleasant sensation to 
be run down by a car — even a 



dream-car with no substance. 

My skin was prickly and my 
palms moist. I could feel the 
blood pounding in my head. 

The door to the police station 
was open. A short flight of stairs 
went up to another door that was 
closed. I did not ring the bell, but 
opened the door and stepped into 
the reception room. 

The room was empty except 
for the uniformed policeman sit- 
ting at the radio bank on the 
other side of the railing with his 
back to me. He wore earphones. 

As the door clicked shut, the 
policeman turned in his swivel 
chair to face me. 

“Hello, Langston, we’ve been 
expecting you,” he said. 

It was Isaac Grogan. 

I smiled and replied with 
calmness that amazed me: 

“Yes, I daresay you have, Zan 
Matl Blekeke.” 

1%/fAXWELL and I were alone 
in the small, bare, brightly 
lighted but windowless room. 

Blekeke had spent a half-hour 
after my arrival trying to find 
out how much I knew. But after 
my initial shocker — letting him 
know that I recognized him — I 
had kept my mind closed tightly: 
and I was keeping it closed now. 
Blekeke was still listening in — I 
had no doubt of that. Maxwell 
knew it too, for he made no at- 
tempt at conversation. 



THE TELENIZER 



41 



He sat with his back to the 
walls in one corner, and I crouch- 
ed in another corner, and we sat 
there, staring at the walls and at 
each other, not daring to speak 
or to think. 

After about ten or fifteen min- 
utes the door opened, and Ble- 
keke stepped in. He was wearing 
earphones, and a wire trailed be- 
hind him. In one hand he carried 
a blaster. 

He smiled broadly and nodded, 
once at each of us. “Something 
show you,” he said. “Watching.” 

He pushed a button on the wall 
beside the door and the lights 
died. For an instant everything 
was black, and I braved myself. 
Then the wall beside Blekeke 
glowed, flickered — and a scene in 
black and white came into focus. 

“This observer room,” Blekeke 
said. “Show what camera top 
meeting hall see.” 

The scene was dim; a half- 
moon bobbed and splashed in 
ocean waves in the background. 
In the right foreground, close and 
large, dark and dull, was the 
spaceship. 

It was Martian, but not mili- 
tary. An old cargo carrier. Its rear 
jets were extinguished, but the 
ship was vibrating. 

Leaving? I wondered — and 
Blekeke caught my thought over 
the telenizer earphones. 

No — just arriving, was his an- 
swer in my mind. But it leave 



again very soon. You with. Soon 
no matter what you know. What 
did. Soon gone. 

How soon ? I demanded. 

Blekeke spoke aloud: “Very 
soon. Fifteen, twenty, half-hour 
minutes. Looking more. All way 
right.” 

I looked at the extreme right 
edge of the picture, where a 
rough, shadowy hillock arose. 
While I watched, an opening ap- 
peared in the hillock and a dim 
human figure emerged. It stood 
erect and walked across the 
stretch of gravel beach toward 
the spaceship. Another figure 
came from the hillock aperture 
and followed the first. 

The thought came from Ble- 
keke: Cultists. Evidence. Prove 
my success. 

Success in what? Why? How? 

Blekeke pushed the button on 
the wall again, and the lights 
were suddenly on, and the wall 
bare. 

“No harm tell you now,” he 
said. “Gone soon. No matter.” 

TTE leaned against the wall and 
crossed his fragile arms 
across his huge red chest. He 
said: 

“Mars home dying. You know. 
Need more somewhere. Earth 
best, but some Earthmen decid- 
ing not want.” He shrugged. 
“Dear Late Doctor — ” he did not 
bother making the mystic sign — 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“was brilliant man. Dr. Homer 
Reighardt — know name? Psy- 
chiatrist. Very old. No, I not 
kill; death natural. I wanted live 
longer, but . he shrugged 
again. “Learned much from, 
howso. He founded cult. I his 
servant after joining. He idea 
very innocent— cure not really 
sick with mild ’nosis.” 

He smiled modestly. “I also 
brilliant person. Learn tech part 
much rapid. Apply own idea, 
which not so innocent. Fact, very 
insidious. Telenize right persons, 
they want Martian then! Vote to 
let come, yups?” 

Maxwell broke in: “Then why 
didn’t you start in on the right 
people at once? Why not set up 
your headquarters in Belgrade 
and telenize the World Council 
members, instead of playing 
around with a bunch of hypo- 
chondriacs here?” 

Blekeke held up his hand. “So 
fast not so. Must work with what 
got. Doctor machine very simple, 
and he telling me not all. Not 
trusting even me all way. Needing 
much work, then. Muchness de- 
velopment. Six months I work- 
ing, then need testing. SRI, oaks? 
So now have proof for Mars 
government, which verysome cau- 
tious. Demanding evidence.” 
This time I broke in. “Ble- 
keke,” I said, with some of the 
respect I was beginning to feel 
for him, “you’re a patriot, I 



guess, and I have to admire you 
for that. But you’re also a 
damned fool. You can’t get away 
with this — and I think you know 
it. There are just too many loop- 
holes.” 

“Where loop-hole?” 

“Well, in the first place, I made 
a phone call before I got here — 
while I was in the car and my 
defense mech was on. As a re- 
sult, the police will be here in a 
very few minutes — probably be- 
fore you can get to the rocket — ” 

Blekeke smiled blandly. “Where 
second place?” 

“In the second place, assum- 
ing that you do get to the 
spaceship and take off before the 
police get here, it still won’t mat- 
ter. They know , now, who has 
been operating the telenizer. 
They can track you down. You’ll 
be picked up long before you get 
to Mars.” I stood up and strode 
purposefully toward him. “Give 
me the blaster, dammit. You’re 
licked before you’re even start- 
ed.” 

Blekeke frowned and pointed 
the blaster at my chest. “Please. 
So fast not so. Go back corner, 
please.” 

I obediently returned to the 
corner and sat down. It had been 
worth a try. 

The Martian lowered the 
weapon and smiled. “You too 
brave. I not like kill. But pfoof 
for loop-hole. All plugged. Look-

ing what front-door camera see. 
Polices here now.” 

He pushed the button on the 
wall. 

A POLICE auto was screeching 
to a halt in the driveway 
before the big house, and a half- 
dozen uniformed men, armed 
with deadly blasters, were piling 
out. Another car was whipping 
around the final curve. 

I knew that Maxwell was giv- 
ing me a look of gratitude, but 
suddenly I wasn’t sure it was 
warranted. I had assumed on a 
sort of blind faith that the police 
would get here in time — but as I 
watched the scene, I didn’t feel 
so good. 

For the policemen were not 
charging the house. They were 
not even looking at it. 

They were milling around, 
aimlessly. No, not aimlessly, ex- 
actly. They were looking for 
something; but they weren’t see- 
ing it. One of them got back in 
the car and used the radio, and 
the others wandered around, 
glancing unseeingly in all di- 
rections. 

“Mass telenosis?” I asked 
quietly, not taking my eyes from 
the scene, feeling my heart pound 
harder as I caught a glimpse of 
the bobbing, slower lights of an- 
other vehicle on the road far 
back. 

Blekeke said, “Yups. Plug all 



loop-hole. Police not see house, 
not see ship. No one see ship 
leave, not knowing Blekeke on 
board. Complete vanish.” He 
shrugged. “Ship keep commercial 
schedule. Take auxiliary power 
to right course, then switch 
rocket. Stopped on way, maybe, 
so what? Telenize searchers, 
yups?” 

“What about the house?" I 
asked. 

“Go boom when we leave,” 
Blekeke said. 

Maxwell said, “Judas! Every- 
one will just assume that we and 
Blekeke and all the cultists have 
gone boom, too. That’s likely to 
end the investigation right there. 
Slow it down plenty, at least.” 

Blekeke nodded applaudingly. 
“Yups. Is so.” 

He pushed the wall -button 
and we had the spaceship scene 
again. Men and Martians were 
loading large crates into the port 
of the ship. The other bulky 
boxes were being moved across 
the beach from the opening in the 
hill. 

“Leaving soon now,” Blekeke 
said as he switched the lights on. 
“That most of vital equipment. 
Other going boom. We work aw- 
ful quickness, yups?” 

“Just how do you mean?” I 
asked, more to kill time than out 
of real curiosity. 

“Ha! You not knowing how 
quickness we work since morn-

ing — since getting Maxwell brain 
band on measure machine Sun 
Ray . .” 

Maxwell exclaimed; “Oh, hell, 
of course! Son of a blunder! 
That’s how you got it.” 

1 HAD already figured that out, 
and I guessed it was the in- 
formation Blekeke had gained 
from Maxwell’s mind that was 
forcing him to act now, before 
he had planned. 

“When learned you planning 
’vestigate SRI, had move fast,” 
Blekeke corroborated. “So did. 
Not know you law man till then. 
Only that Langston mind stop- 
ped ’nosis. Not even knowing 
why. Worried for while — whew!” 
He wiped the mock perspiration 
from his brow and smiled. 

I said, “The thugs who at- 
tacked Maxwell and me were 
Grogan’s men. May I ask now — 
just out of curiosity — were they 
telenized, or was Grogan?” 
Blekeke seemed happy to re- 
ply. “Grogan. Reighardt hap- 
pened work on Grogan in Cl. 
Also your brain wave number in 
file, but I getting first on Sun 
Ray machine.” 

I had wondered about that, 
and there was another question 
that was bothering me. 

“When you started that blood 
dripping in the bathtub,” I said, 
“was that a deliberate attempt to 
scare me away, or was that part 



of the standard treatment?” 

“Standard,” Blekeke replied. 
“Subject no longer trust own 
senses after. But recognize ’nosis, 
so trying frighten you. Work 
good on others.” 

I started to ask another ques- 
tion, but he switched on the 
spaceship loading scene again. 

A crane was hauling the last 
huge crate into the hold. All the 
humans — the SRI cultists — were 
apparently aboard ship. None 
were visible. A few Martians 
stood near the ship, some of 
them looking toward the hillock 
opening, and some watching the 
loading. 

Suddenly two policemen came 
into view on the screen, walking 
casually over the hill in which 
the opening was located. At the 
top they halted and looked out 
over the ocean. 

One of the men looked over his 
shoulder and pulled a bottle from 
an inside pocket. He offered it to 
his companion, who shook his 
head. The man shrugged and 
took a deep swallow himself, 
tucking the bottle inside his 
jacket again. 

I caught a sudden note of 
mild alarm from Blekeke’s mind, 
which reminded me that he was 
still listening for careless thoughts 
of mine. 

The policemen continued walk- 
ing toward the beach, heading to 
the right of the spaceship. I saw 



THE TELENIZER 



45 



one of the Martians step back 
into the shadow of the ship. The 
others followed the policemen 
with their eyes. 

“We best going now,” Blekeke 
said. He reached to turn off the 
picture . 

And his hand froze. He saw the 
same thing I saw, and at just 
about the same time. 

He saw a dog. 

And he must have felt the 
triumphant, incoherent chortle 
that gushed from my mind. 

fTHHE dog was a small, ragged, 
spotted terrier. It came trot- 
ting absentmindedly over the 
hill after the policemen, and at 
the top it stopped. It quivered. 
It sat down, pointed its nose at 
the spaceship and opened its 
mouth in a howl I could almost 
hear. 

Then the scene was gone; the 
lights in the room glowed; Ble- 
keke was pointing the blaster at 
me. 

And his trigger finger was 
trembling. 

He was shaking, very slightly, 
all over. His red-hued skin had 
turned a much paler shade. 

I don’t think I moved a muscle 
while I waited for him to speak. 

“I should killing you,” he said. 
“Right now, I should killing you. 
Then maybe killing me. Or make 
boom.” He laughed shrilly, al- 
most hysterically. “You very 



cleverish. Finding one weakener. 
Tell polices bringing dogs.” 
“Why, no,” I said. “As a mat- 
ter of fact, I told the dogs to 
bring the police.” 

That caught his interest. His 
hand on the blaster relaxed 
enough so that I could breath. 

“That call I made from the 
car, coming here,” I said. “It 
wasn’t to the police. After the 
results of my first call to them, 
I thought it was just possible 
that you had somehow telenized 
all the desk sergeants. I wasn’t 
thinking too sharp just then. 
Anyway, I called the city dog 
pound, instead. I told ’em to get 
as many dogs out here as fast as 
they possibly could.” 

Blekeke spoke in a very soft 
voice. “Cleverly, cleverly. And 
I giving self way.” 

"You sure did,” I agreed. 
“There’s dogs in every damn 
vision you dream up, you hate 
’em so much. Same way some 
people have snakes.” 

Blekeke gestured with the 
blaster. He had regained some of 
his color, and he wasn’t trem- 
bling. “Getting up now. We leav- 
ing. Not kill if not necessary.” 
Maxwell and I stood up. Ble- 
keke backed through the door, 
motioning for us to follow. He 
walked us ahead of him along a 
corridor and down two flights of 
stairs, staying a safe distance be- 
hind us. 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The entrance to the tunnel was 
in the basement, through a door 
that looked like any other door. 

Blekeke took off the earphones 
he was wearing and tossed them 
aside. 

“This ’nizer blow up with 
house,” he said. 

The tunnel was wide, straight 
and brightly lighted. The op- 
posite end was a small black dot, 
but it didn’t take us long to get 
there. 

My thoughts were running 
wild, now that no one was listen- 
ing. 

The dogs had bothered Ble- 
keke, but how badly? He seemed 
so damned sure of himself now. 
No hesitation at all. Or — was it 
merely resignation? I didn’t 
know. But if he once got us 
aboard that spaceship, his plan 
had a ridiculously good chance of 
succeeding. 

. And would that be so 
bad? Were his motives so ignoble, 
or his methods so very atro- 
cious? 

I drove that line of thought 
from my mind. I could think 
about that later . 

¥^ROM the outside entrance of 
the tunnel, the dark spaceship 
seemed disturbingly close, and 
the expanse between it and us 
free of impediments of any kind. 
Only fifty or sixty quick steps, 
and then . The Martians at 



the ship saw us and climbed 
aboard. The ship . was beginning 
to vibrate again. 

The two policemen were wan- 
dering around by the water’s 
edge. We could hear the dogs 
howling. Several others had 
joined in now, but we couldn’t 
see them. They were above us. 

“Walk slow to ship,” Blekeke 
instructed, tenseness obvious in 
his voice. “Casual. Like nothing. 

I right behind.” 

Maxwell and 1 glanced at each 
other and stepped from the aper- 
ture to the gravelly beach and 
started walking very slowly and 
casually toward the spaceship. 

We had gone about ten feet 
when we heard, in the short inter- 
vals when the dogs weren’t howl- 
ing, the crunching footsteps of 
Blekeke behind us. They were 
faltering. 

I couldn’t resist a backward 
glance. 

I saw about a half-dozen dogs 
on the hill behind and above 
Blekeke. They were squatting on 
their haunches, noses pointed at 
the spaceship, and they were 
creating the damnedest racket I 
had ever heard. Surely the cops 
would at least suspect something! 

Blekeke was walking stiffly, 
slowly, keeping the blaster point- 
ed at us, making a visible effort 
not to turn around. 

“Hey, you goddam dogs!” one 
of the policemen on the beach 



THE TELENIZER

shouted. “Shut the hell up!” He 
picked up a rock and threw it, 
but he was too far away. The 
missile whizzed low over my 
head. I ducked instinctively, 
turning to see where the stone 
hit. It missed the dogs by a good 
fifteen or twenty feet. 

Other policemen were appear- 
ing from the direction of the road, 
running anxiously toward the 
dogs, looking in the direction the 
dogs were pointing. 

And seeing nothing. 

Other dogs were appearing, too, 
some well within the vision of 
Blekeke — but another quick 
glance showed me that he was 
staring rigidly ahead and walking 
steadily. 

We were entering the shadow 
of the spaceship. Less than twenty 
feet to go. Even in the dim light, 
I could almost distinguish the 
features of the Martian waiting 
there to haul us aboard. 

npHE policemen on the beach 
were now walking back to 
join the others. The one who 
had yelled and thrown the stone 
now whistled shrilly, and shout- 
ed, “Commere. you lousy, flea- 
bitten mutts, and shut up!” 

He whistled again. Insistently. 

One dog stopped howling and 
slunk forward timidly, then halt- 
ed. 

The whistle was a shrill com- 
mand. 



I heard a soft gasp, perhaps 
a sob, from Blekeke. 

The dog trotted slowly, re- 
luctantly, forward, tail between 
its legs, growling and whining at 
the same time. 

“Running! Running! Hurry!” 
Blekeke screamed. 

Instead, I turned around to 
watch, and so did Maxwell. 

The policeman continued to 
whistle. Another dog, a large, 
shaggy collie, left the pack. But 
it was not timid, and it paid no 
attention to the policemen — it had 
seen Blekeke, and it rushed at 
him, snarling and yapping. 

The Martian made a gurgling 
noise. A shudder shook his frame,

and he turned and fired. 

I was watching, without really 
comprehending what I saw, 
the policeman who had been 
whistling. Abruptly he stopped 
whistling. He was looking. But 
not at the dogs, nor at the other 
policemen. Not even at the 
shaggy collie that vanished sud- 
denly in a blinding flash. 

He was looking at the space- 
ship. And seeing it. He rubbed a 
hand across his eyes. 

When the collie was hit, the 
terrier which had slunk forward 
turned. At five feet from Blekeke, 
it growled and leaped at him. 

Blekeke collapsed. The blaster 
dropped from his hand, and he 
crumpled into a trembling, 
twitching, sobbing lump on the 
ground. 

I rushed to grab the blaster, 
and Maxwell kicked the snarling, 
frightened dog away. 



At the same time, the police- 
man yelled, “Jupiter! It is a 
spaceship! I knew I seen some- 
thin’. I may have had a drink, 
but I ain’t crazy!” 

He fired while he was yelling, 
and the Martian who had been 
leaning from the port ducked in- 
side. The ship shuddered and 
rose quickly, with a rumble that 
was almost drowned by the 
racket the dogs were making. 

The policeman rubbed his eyes. 
“Huh? ... I coulda swore I saw 
a spaceship. Right there. Just 
now. Just a second ago.” 

“Man, you really are drunk,” 
his companion said. 

The house blew up an instant 
later. No policemen were killed 
or injured in the explosion. They 
were all gathered on the beach 
to see why the dogs were howling. 
It took a bit of explaining.

Getting a job in space was a 
big problem— but they solved 



it neatly by making i 



W HENEVER Old Mott 
came to the asteroid 
with his little people, I 
always made Dad take me with 
him. I was fascinated with the 
little people. I was too fascinated. 
It finally made trouble. 

My father was Personnel Di- 
rector of the local Asteroid 
Mines, Inc. diggings on our tiny 
planet. He was one of the most 



small I 



important persons under the 
Dome. The workers and families 
of Point Montana always lifted 
their hats and smiled to him, and 
it was fun to be walking beside 
him and see the respect he got. 
Only the General Manager got 
more, and he was bald and they 
kidded about “Old Hat.” But no 
one ever kidded with my father. 

We climbed up the steps of 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Mott’s space-burned old craft 
with a feeling of importance, at 
least on my part, because no one 
was allowed aboard an Employ- 
ment rocket except the Person- 
nel Director of the asteroid and 
one or two other high officials. 

Old Mott met us at the en- 
trance and bowed and grinned, 
his funny, old-fashioned glasses 
glittering and his almost tooth- 
less mouth shapeless in the smile. 
Then there was a long waste of 
talk while they had a glass of 
wine together. Meanwhile I was 
anxiously waiting, watching the 
door that burned so bright in my 
imagination. On the other side of 
its prosaic gray metal the little 
people rested. 

“No technicians,” apologized 
Mott. “I can give you some 
cooks, and some helpers and some 
housewife -hopefuls this trip. 
Many fine ones.” 

My father shook his head. 
“Unskilled labor is a drug here, 
Mott. Like everywhere. I feel 
sorry for the poor devils, but I 
can’t take any, especially the 
housewife-hopefuls.” 

Old Mott looked disappointed. 
“Some of these people have been 
in space for many years,” he 
muttered. “Too many. It ain’t 
fair, Chet.” 

“Send them back to Earth.” 
Old Mott shook his head and 
sighed. Finally he and my father 
rose, and we went into the heav- 



ily locked room where the little 
people were. 

/\LD Mott had them arranged 
by profession. It was a 
small room, not over ten by ten, 
and three walls were filled with 
shelves. The little people were 
propped up along the shelves, 
with tiny name-plates beneath 
each one. They were about seven 
inches high and stood rigid like 
so many dolls. Only they weren’t 
dolls; they were real people. 

They were the poor, the un- 
skilled, the have-not hopefuls. 
They couldn’t get jobs on Earth. 
They couldn’t pay their way to 
the planets. So they signed con- 
tracts with Greater New York 
Employment or one of those out- 
fits and traveled from planet to 
planet and out through the as- 
teroids looking for work. In one 
of these Employment ships, when 
they were reduced in size, you 
could get a couple of hundred; 
and as little people they needed 
very little food or oxygen. Full- 
sized in life, the ship wouldn’t 
take two dozen. And so they 
traveled, in a fitful sleep, reduced 
in size, reduced in hope, trying 
to find a place to work and set- 
tle down and make a home. 

Old Mott covered his stocks of 
little people with cellophane. 
That was so when Father or any- 
body picked one up. it wouldn’t 
get dirty from handling. Some-

times you almost thought their 
tiny eyes watched you. Other 
times, you couldn’t be sure. In 
reduction they were supposed to 
sleep, with the agent doing all 
of the interviewing for them. 

I wandered down the aisles, 
staring at the little people from 
Earth, while my father and Old 
Mott argued about a handful of 
laborers — all that Dad was going 
to buy this trip. 

I was never allowed to touch 
the stock. It was a very impor- 
tant rule. Everybody felt a lit- 
tle ashamed about the little 
people and was sorry because 
they couldn’t find a place to live. 
You were very careful not to han- 
dle them unnecessarily. 

But down on the end one of 
them had fallen on the floor. I 
picked it up. It was a woman, 
maybe a girl. She was staring 
right at me with bold blue eyes 
and a smile. I would swear that 
she looked at me and winked. 
Hands trembling to feel that un- 
speakable warm life in my hand, 
I hastened to put her back on 
the shelf. 

There was no place for her. 
Old Mott was getting pretty old 
at the time, and, I guess, care- 
less. All the spots were filled and 
he must have let her fall to the 
floor and his weak old eyes didn’t 
see her. 

I wondered how long she’d been 
there. 



¥ WALKED back to where my 
father and Old Mott were. 
My father and the old man had 
selected three laborers and were 
studying them through magnify- 
ing glasses, my father telling Old 
Mott how defective they were, 
and Old Mott insisting that they 
were real good merchandise. Just 
as I came up to them there was 
a commotion outside the ship. 
Some men yelled. I was curious; 
but I wanted to tell Old Mott 
about the tiny woman first. 

“Father — ” 

“Please, son,” said my father. 
“Don’t interrupt.” 

He was always touchy in the 
little room. It was, I think, the 
aura of failure and hopelessness. 
It was the embarrassment of hav- 
ing to touch and handle and scan 
the tiny bodies of other people 
less fortunate than him, and de- 
ciding their fates in dollars and 
cents. 

“Mr. Mott — ” 

“Go see who’s climbing the 
ship, son,” he ordered without 
looking. “I haven’t got much 
time left. I’m due back on Mars 
Friday — ” 

I should have put the tiny fig- 
ure on the table. But there was 
an unholy fascination in holding 
that hot little figure in my hand 
— a person born before me, an 
adult, and here she was a tiny 
foot-ruler of life in my hand. So 
I went out to see what the trou- 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ble was about, still holding her. 

It was the Sheriff. He was 
herding along two men who 
hadn’t worked out well on the 
asteroid. He had them in hand- 
cuffs, and they were fighting and 
cursing as he prodded them into 
the ship. My father and Old 
Mott came out and set down on 
the table the three tiny figures 
my father had chosen. 

Then Old Mott and the Sheriff 
and my father dragged the two 
men into the Converter and shut 
the door. I could hear the explo- 
sive cries of the rejected men 
who had gotten into trouble on 
our asteroid. Then the machin- 
ery cut over them, whining with 
a scary sound that made me 
shake all over. Once I heard a 
scream. 

Pretty soon they all came out 
again. The Sheriff went away, 
saying, “I hope you pick better 
ones this time, Mr. Blake.” 

Old Mott had two tiny figures 
in his hands. He wrapped them 
in cellophane and put them in 
his pocket. 

‘‘It’ll be a cold day in Janu- 
ary before I sell them two again,” 
he said. “They been getting into 
trouble everywhere I take ’em. 
Let ’em cool for a while.” 

Then he and my father took 
the three new little figures and 
went back in the Converter. The 
machinery whined again, but this 
time it sounded different. Pretty 

THE LITTLEST PEO PLE 



soon they came out, and I blink- 
ed. I always blinked when I saw 
those tiny figures go into the 
Converter and come out twice as 
big as me, full-sized and smiling 
and being real deferential to 
Father. 

“This is wonderful, Mr. Blake,” 
said one. “We’ll sure work hard, 
Mr. Mott.” 

“It was real kind of you to 
take us on, Mr. Blake,” said an- 
other. “We ain’t never had a 
chance before.” 

rpHEY looked at my father with 
smiles that tried too hard, and 
held their hats in their hands 
and bobbed their heads. You 
could see the whites of their 
eyes like a dog’s. They wore the 
faded blues and reds of workers, 
and they were clumsy on their 
feet after so many months of 
being little. They were young, 
but they looked old and tired, 
and I had to swallow in my 
throat when they looked out of 
the window and saw how small 
and gray our little asteroid was, 
and how they kept on smiling 
and bowing, and swallowing their 
disappointment at their new 
home. 

Father smiled back at them, 
but he’d heard it all before. Some 
of them would start drinking. 
Some of them would get in trou- 
ble with women. Some of them 
would get bored and make trou- 

53 



ble. Not one in ten ever really 
liked our asteroid and really be- 
came one of us. 

Maybe it was partly our fault, 
because it made a big difference 
how you came to the asteroid. 
If you came in a regular rocket, 
full-sized and with luggage, it 
was easier. Those were the en- 
gineers and doctors and scien- 
tists, and they were important in 
the Dome. But the little people 
made big lived on the sides of 
the Dome, where there was less 
oxygen, and they didn’t ever 
make much or have much. 

My father and I said good-by 
to Mr. Mott and climbed down 
the loading ladder. Old Mott 
peered after us through his glasses 
and smiled and waved, and my 
father waved the contracts up at 
him — the contracts that said that 
Father would deduct Old Mott’s 
money from the laborers’ wages 
every month, and also pay the 
Greater New York Employment 
its fee. 

Then we started back for Point 
Montana, the new workers un- 
steady on their legs and still 
trying to be nice. My father 
walked between them, bracing 
them with his arms, and answer- 
ed their questions. I brought up 
the rear. 

And that night, nearly eight 
years ago, when I got home, I 
found Gleam in my pocket. I 
had forgotten to give her back to 



Old Mott. I had stolen one of the 
little people. 

N aturally, i didn’t know 
what to do with her — until 
I went in my sister’s playroom 
and saw her dolls. Then I gave 
her to my sister Kate and told 
her that it was a new kind of 
doll, a used-up little person that 
Old Mott had given me on the 
promise that I wouldn’t tell the 
folks. I swore her to secrecy. 

Kate jumped up and down, 
hugging the little figure in cello- 
phane. “She gleams,” she cried, 
“I’ll call her Gleam.” 

For a while she played with 
Gleam like her other dolls, and 
our folks didn’t notice because 
on Point Montana there was less 
power and fewer appliances and 
we all had to work — even my 
mother had to do her own wash- 
ing by hand — and so we kids were 
left pretty much to entertain our- 
selves. 

I figured Kate would get tired 
of Gleam and I could return her 
to Old Mott on his next trip. I 
worried quite a lot in the mean- 
time, because I knew they had 
rigid laws about handling the 
little people. 

The very day Old Mott came 
back, Kate brought Gleam to me. 

“Look,” she said. “I was dump- 
ing my stuff in the toy box, and 
your dump-truck fell on her.” 
There was something wrong 



54

with one of the legs. Gleam had 
straight, slim legs — but now one 
of them was oddly crooked. I 
ran to Dad’s library and got the 
magnifying glass. 

Gleam was good-looking, with 
a curved generous mouth that 
smiled and blue eyes that always 
had a far-off look of waking 
sleep. But now she was turning 
the lips in, and the cheek hollows 
stood out in pain, and there was 
sweat on her forehead. The blue 
eyes were closed. I got scared. 
I knew she was going to die. 

“I’m going to tell Mother,” 
said Kate, looking at my face 
and beginning to whimper. “I 
didn’t bring her here, and I don’t 
like her any more.” 

“All right, stupid, tell her,” I 
said in misery. I was thinking 
what it would be like to go to 
prison — but Kate wouldn’t un- 
derstand that. 

“Mom will probably stop our 
going to the videopix for three 
months,” I said. That was some- 
thing she could understand. 

Kate stopped whimpering. 
“You can have her,” she said. 
“You can do whatever you want. 
I won’t say anything.” 

T DIDN’T plan to give her back 
to Old Mott before I asked 
some questions. I casually asked 
him about the whole process, 
and then about injuries to the 
little people. He’d been reduced 

THE LITTLEST PEOPLE 



once himself, a long time ago. 

“Don’t feel a thing,” he said. 
“The Converter goes on, and you 
go to sleep while your molecules 
close up and a lot of water is 
taken out of you. Then you just 
drift and dream, slow, lazy, easy- 
like, until you get your full size 
again.” 

“What if they got hurt?” 

“It might wake ’em up,” he 
chuckled. “But ain’t nobody 
gonna buy damaged goods, so 
they just better not get hurt.” 

That scared me more. If I gave 
her back to him, he couldn’t get 
her a job now. 

“Say, Chet,” he asked my fa- 
ther, “I didn’t leave a girl with 
you last time, did I? I got one 
missin’. Cute little blonde, she 
was.” 

My father smiled and shook 
his head. “You know I never take 
the cute ones. They only get the 
men to fighting, and make trou- 
ble. You probably bootlegged her 
to some slave-trader.” 

Old Mott laughed and winked 
and said he’d filled out a missing 
persons report, but, for all of 
him, one missing was just one 
less to worry about. 

“Won’t they — won’t they send 
you to prison for that?” I asked, 
round-eyed. 

Old Mott roared. “Prison? 
Naw, son, who cares about the 
little people?” 

After that, I was determined 

55 



not to give her back to him. 

I got a first aid book and set 
Gleam’s leg, using some of 
Mom’s nailboards for splints. 
Then I put her in a pigeon-hole 
in my desk in my room, so I 
could check up on her. I even 
fed her with an eye-dropper like 
I’d seen Old Mott do once. 

“Sugar and water once every 
month,” he had once said. “God, 
ain’t it a shame us reliable folk 
got to eat so much expensive 
stuff when they get by on sugar 
and water?” 

TT was about two weeks after 
that when I got my next 
shock. I had checked on Gleam 
and found her eyes open and 
her face back to normal. Since 
she didn’t move at all, I figured 
her leg was healing. 

Then one night I sat down to 
do my homework and found a 
scrap of paper on my desk in 
front of the pigeon-hole. I could 
see some tiny scratches on it — 
some writing. I got the magnify- 
ing glass, my heart thumping. 

“An injury might wake ’em 
up,” Old Mott had said. 

I read the note: 

Littl boy. You brok my 
leg. Give me bak to the 
Mployment. 

With trembling hands, I pulled 
her out of the pigeon-hole. I 
could feel the warmth of her 
body, and felt that I could even 



see her breathe. She was awake! 
I looked at her through the mag- 
nifying glass and tried to talk 
to her, but I could see the tiny 
head shake. She kept trying to 
raise her hand, and at last I saw 
she wanted the pencil. 

Littl boy, she wrote in tiny, 
tiny script. I cant beer you. Rite 
me note. Reel small note. 

I guessed then that my voice 
must sound like roaring in her 
ears. 

I wrote her: I can't give you 
back till the next employment 
rocket. Are you all right? 

She wrote: I hurt. Im lonly. 1 
want to go home. 

At that point I felt very sorry 
for her, and I felt guilty too. I 
held my breath while she took 
off the splint and tried her leg. 

She moved slowly and with a 
limp. She walked the whole 
length of the desk, but the limp 
didn’t go away. She put her 
hands to her tiny blonde head 
and shook as if in terror. 

Wide-eyed, I pushed the writ- 
ing pad to her. 

I'm rooned, she wrote in 
panic. I limp. Littl boy youve 
rooned my life. 

Maybe it'll get better, I told 
her, sick myself. 

I was beetiful, she wrote, but 
whos gone marry a crippld girl? 

I was utterly miserable. Her 
leg looked all right, but the limp 
wouldn’t go away. In my child-

like reasoning. I had ruined her 
life, and in my guilt I didn’t 
know what to do. I couldn’t tell 
Old Mott; I couldn’t tell my 
father. Through damaging her 
leg, I had deprived her of a 
chance to get hired through Em- 
ployment, and my father was 
the kind of man who took grim 
satisfaction in his principles. 

“We are leaders,” he would say, 
“and we must have principles. 
I would as soon send my own 
son to prison as allow injustice 
to pass.” 

It was this shuddery thought 
of his detached anger that im- 
prisoned me with my problem. 
The only thing I could think of 
was to make Gleam into a 
schoolteacher. Miss Griswold, our 
teacher, had a withered arm and 
was very old. She was saving up 
to return to Earth. I figured that 
when I got to be a little older 
and understudied my father in 
his job as Personnel Director, I 
could take care of Gleam, and it 
wouldn’t matter if she limped. 
Such is the selfish judgment of 
tender years. 

I told Gleam of my idea. 

No, she wrote. I was waittres. 
I dont want s cool. I will kill you 
if you dont let me go. 

I thought her threat was idle. 

T ATE at night, there is a 
" change of machinery in the 
asteroid Dome. All the lights go 



off, and the oxygen goes up, and 
they blow the scent of mountain 
pine trees through the ventila- 
tors. I remember waking in the 
middle of the night with a weight 
on my chest, and drawing the 
pure air into my lungs and feel- 
ing that something was horribly 
wrong. 

Gleam stood on my chest. Her 
figure was silhouetted against the 
dim starlight outside my window. 
She had my pocketknife. She 
was throwing her whole weight 
on it to stab me with the open 
blade, and before I could stop 
her, it plunged into my chest. 

I screamed. Stupid, ignorant, 
revengeful Gleam — she had 
meant her threat of killing me! 

When my parents came run- 
ning, I clutched her hot body in 
my hand under the covers. I 
could feel my own blood on my 
pajamas and I was scared and 
sick and angry. But the act of 
pulling up the covers had dis- 
lodged the knife, and I realized 
that I was not seriously hurt. 

I told my parents I’d had a 
nightmare. 

“Dreaming of the little peo- 
ple,” my mother said to my fa-' 
ther. “You see, I told you he 
was too young to go on the Em- 
ployment Rocket!” 

My father shrugged and insist- 
ed that a son of his should be 
strong-minded, and they went 
back to bed. 



THE LITTLEST PEOPLE

I got up on the edge of my 
bed and leaned over and vomited, 
feeling hatred and an underlying 
abysmal guilt toward the soft, 
squirming thing I held in my 
hands. 

From the moment she plunged 
the knife blade in me, I was 
filled with anger and determina- 
tion that she would not ruin my 
life, even by revealing her exist- 
ence to my parents, who, I 
thought, would send me to 
prison. My idea of making her 
into a schoolteacher and hiring 
her to replace Miss Griswold, 
when I should have the power in 
a few years, grew from a promise 
snatched out of the air into real 
purpose. 

She objected violently, first 
crying and then cursing me so 
loudly that I could faintly hear 
the words. As I heard the squeak- 
ing vileness pour from her tiny 
lips, my hate toward her deep- 
ened into an almost holy rever- 
ence for my mission. She had 
been a poor girl; she had not 
had much education; she only 
wanted to marry and settle down, 
or at least get a job as a wait- 
ress, which was the only thing 
she knew. 

My feeling of pity for all the 
little folk, embarrassment at their 
poor possessions and awkward 
ways and helplessness, centered 
on her — her shallow and vile be- 
ing. As I chained her to the desk 



with a solid gold-plated watch- 
chain that night, I had accepted 
the problem of her existence. 

Next evening I went to work. 

You are still good-looking, I 
wrote her, but you are stupid. 
I will make you less stupid. I will 
teach you how to be as smart and 
polite as Mrs. Ellensberg, the 
Chief Chemist’s wife. 

Thus stirred by my emotions 
of fear, anger and pity, I laid out 
her schedule. When she refused to 
cooperate, I took the tiny arm 
and twisted it until she screamed. 
After that, she did what I wanted. 

The period of childhood has a 
prisonlike quality of “do”s and 
“don’t”s, and my own discipline 
had been no less severe than that 
which I passed on to her. I made 
her do my homework with me; 
I made her take exercise; and 
every night promptly at nine, I 
shut her in my bureau drawer. 

In no other home on Point 
Montana could I have gotten 
away with it. But my parents 
were very busy people, and they 
left their children to amuse them- 
selves, seldom even coming into 
our rooms. My sister Kate, of 
course, knew all about Gleam; 
but she was under my control, as 
younger sisters often are, and the 
secret was kept. 

/"WF course, there were crises. 

One time my parents found 
the cat with its throat slit. I had 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to talk fast to get out of that one. 
I was going to put Gleam on 
bread and water for that sin, 
but when I saw the long, deep 
scratches that the cat had given 
her in its playful way, I said 
nothing. 

Then there was the time that 
she got loose and filled her thim- 
ble with Father’s wine. I usu- 
ally fed her with scraps from 
the table, for sugar and water 
wouldn’t do for Gleam now that 
she moved around and was 
awake. I kept the thimble in her 
drawer for her to have her milk 
in. 

She came weaving into the 
study, slopping wine out of her 
thimble and singing a song that 
astounded my unsophisticated 
ears. 

“Little boy,” she said in her 
tiny voice, "I’m going to spit in 
your eye.” She stood on her tip- 
toes, her blonde hair hanging 
loose, laughing. “Wow, what a 
party,” she cried enthusiastically. 
“What a crime!” 

I barely had time to scoop her 
up and hide her in the bureau 
before my father came snooping 
suspiciously into the room. 

He smiled when he saw me 
with a thimbleful of wine. 

“The young must learn by imi- 
tation,” he said, “but you’ll never 
get in much trouble if you only 
take a thimbleful at a time, 
John.” 



Then he gave me my first real 
wineglass full of wine, and I knew 
I was growing up. 

We had a man-to-man talk in 
his study that night, about my 
future and my relations with 
Lucy Ellensberg, whom I had 
dated at school, and how I would 
go to work in Employment after 
I had been to school on Ceres. I 
almost told him about Gleam 
then, but when I started to talk 
about the little people, he got a 
pained look in his eye. 

“I’m sorry, John,” he said, “but 
you mustn’t go overboard for 
them. They’re people — but they’re 
ignorant, superstitious and un- 
disciplined. They must be treated 
differently.” 

Afterward, back in my room, I 
found Gleam crying in the bu- 
reau drawer. She was still drunk. 

“I am going to kill myself, 
little boy,” she wept. “Nobody 
loves me.” 

“You have a home here,” I 
told her. “You are being trained 
for a good job. Soon you’ll be 
able to teach school and marry 
someone who doesn’t mind your 
limp.” 

She shook her head. “Someday 
you’ll pay for this, little boy,” 
she said, and then hiccupped and 
fell over and went to sleep. I 
couldn’t help grinning. I reached 
in and brushed back her hair and 
eased her tiny figure into a more 
comfortable position. 



THE LITTLEST PEOPLE

TT was when I went to school 
-*• on Ceres that the change took 
place. Up until that time Gleam 
was like a pet, very little more to 
me than a frog or dog. But on 
Ceres, I had my first real drunk 
and my first real date; on Ceres 
it was I who didn’t want to work, 
feeling the freedom of a real city, 
strange people, exciting things. 

Gleam became my conscience. 
And I didn’t particularly like it. 

I had taken her to Ceres with 
many misgivings, not because I 
wanted to but because I was 
afraid to leave her behind. There 
were '"many other little people 
there, kept by the people of Ceres 
as pets just as I kept Gleam. 
Most of them were alcoholics or 
the demented who did not wish 
to become big again. So I was 
able to keep Gleam openly. 

And now, at last, I began to 
think of getting rid of her. 

The second day, I was walking 
down the astonishingly wide 
street with its gash of neon red 
and blue and green signs. Gleam, 
as usual, was standing in my 
pocket and leaning her elbows on 
the edge as she looked out. We 
came to the Ceres office of the 
Greater New York Employment. 
Suddenly, I stopped. 

“Gleam,” I said, speaking soft- 
ly and a little high-pitched, the 
way I’d found she could best 
understand me. “Maybe it’s time 
for you to be big again.” 



“No! Not now, little boy, it 
isn’t time.” 

The tiny voice was almost a 
cry of terror. Something about it 
puzzled me. 

When I asked her what was 
wrong, she wouldn’t talk to me. 

That night, I told my room- 
mate, Rand, about it. 

He shrugged. “They get afraid. 
They get used to being taken care 
of. She won’t ever want to be big 
again.” 

Now, for the first time, I was 
eager to get rid of Gleam; and 
she wouldn’t go. She put on airs 
on Ceres. She acted very strange- 
ly, insisting on complete privacy 
for dressing and undressing, and 
when we traveled she preferred 
to ride on my neck, holding onto 
my ear and shouting wry com- 
ments at me. 

“That Alice you been eying,” 
she said one day. “She’s a com- 
mon slut. You’ve got a future at 
Point Montana; she’s after you. 
Better watch out, little boy.” 

“I can take care of myself.” 

“Those clothes!” she laughed, 
pointing to another girl that I 
had been trying to be introduced 
to. “She dresses like a waitress. 
And listen to her language! Split 
infinitives and dangling partici- 
ples all over the place. One would 
do well to ignore these street- 
women, little boy!” 

After that, I didn’t dare ask 
the girl for a date.

G LEAM helped me with my 
lessons. She goaded me into 
doing them. She criticized my 
clothes and my manners and, 
since she knew cities and I did 
not, even told me where to go 
around the town. This was an- 
noying to me — but with her help 
I did well in school, and, due to 
her knowledge of the seamier side 
of life, achieved a certain fame 
among my contemporaries as a 
man of the world. 

She became increasingly med- 
dlesome, and we had arguments 
often. Especially when I had 
dates and left her behind. I would 
come home to find her pacing my 
desk. “Well,” she would sneer, 
“did the little darling find out 
how much you wilJq^aKe and 
how big a home youown and hd^f

much money your family has in 
the bank?” 

“Never mind.” 

“You’re an idiot, little boy. 
You have apples for brains.” 

We finally had it out on my 
last week at school. 

“Gleam,” I said, “when I go 
back, I’ll have to get married, 
you know. That is, I can’t hold 
a job in Employment unless I’m 
married. And Lucy Ellensberg is 
sort of — ” 

“What happens to me?” she 
cried. 

“You’ll have to get big and get 
a job. I kept you because I 
ruined your life. But in our house 
you’ve learned enough to get by 
as a schoolteacher or a govern- 
ess. You’ve learned how the other 
half lives. I’ve paid for my sin in 
stealing you and breaking your 
leg.” 

“You could do better than 
Lucy Ellensberg!” 

“I don’t want to do better.” 

She picked up her thimble and 
tossed off the spate of beer I’d 
poured for her. 

“There’s me, for instance,” she 
said. “After all, I know your 
habits — ” 

I burst into laughter. “You! 
Marry you! Why, Gleam, I think 
of you as a sister, with your bad 
leg and — ’’ 

Then I stopped laughing. Be- 
cause she was staring at me with 
something in her tiny eyes that 



I'd never seen before. All the 
years, we’d fought every step of 
the way. I had found her vile and 
obscene. She had found me child- 
ishly cruel. I had made her life 
hell at home, and she had made 
mine hell on Ceres. Always it had 
been with a veiled contempt on 
both sides. 

But this time her look was 
different. 

“I’m sorry, John. I’m sorry 
you said that.” 

Before, I had always been 
“Little Boy.” And I had always 
called her Gleam, because I knew 
her real name was impossibly 
corny. 

My chest felt hot. I was em- 
barrassed. “I’m sorry too, Milli- 
cent,” I said. “But this is as far 
as we can go together.” 

npHE next day I took her to 
Employment, and she didn’t 
complain. A thick distance lay 
between us. 

They accepted her. The last 
time I ever saw tiny Gleam was 
as she strode importantly up and 
down the Director’s desk, limp- 
ing but waving her hands in 
earnest and giving them complete 
instructions on the important job 
she wanted. Somewhere far away. 

“As far away as possible from 
provincial bumpkins like John 
Blake!” she cried to the Director. 
“You will make a good deal of 
money from me, my good man!” 



62

His jaw dropped, and the others 
in the room gathered around the 
self-important, strutting little fig- 
ure as I slipped out to freedom. 

I was oddly disturbed at the 
parting, yet oddly pleased. The 
years of discipline had paid off 
for Gleam. She’d always had a 
good brain, just an undeveloped 
one; now she was fast, capable, 
bursting with confidence. I knew 
she’d get along. 

The next months were exceed- 
ingly enjoyable. For the first time 
in more than seven years, I didn’t 
have to worry about Gleam. At 
first, I missed the business of 
feeding her and taking care of 
her wants; but far more than that 
I enjoyed being able to exercise 
privacy. I read what I want- 
ed, kept the hours that I wanted, 
and dated the girls I wanted. 

Finally I returned to start my 
new job in Employment on Point 
Montana. 

“I won’t ask too many ques- 
tions about Ceres,” smiled my 
father, who was noticeably older. 
“You seem to have matured 
astonishingly for your age. Ceres 
was good for you, John. By the 
way, Lucy Ellensberg is coming 
over for supper tonight.” 

I had anticipated that night 
for a long time. Lucy seemed 
lovely; she had charm and man- 
ners; I was only a little disap- 
pointed to see how much her 
thoughts revolved around petty 



matters of the Point, and how 
soft and selfish she seemed. 

It was all very routine. We 
were alone; the night lights of 
Point Montana gleamed in fuzzy 
softness; we stood in my parents’ 
tiny garden and smelled the pine 
scent of the ventilators, and I 
proposed and was accepted. 

“We’ll live in a small house by 
the edge of the Dome at first,” 
I told her. “I want to get the feel 
of the workmen’s lives, since I'll 
be hiring them.” 

“Well,” she said dubiously. 
“Only for a very short time, John. 
After all, there’s our part of the 
social calendar to keep up!” 

“And then we’ll have to get 
started on a family.” 

She laughed: “Later, John. It’s 
all right for you — you’ve been 
out to see the world and had 
your fling. But for me it’s the 
first time away from home. I 
want parties! I want to learn to 
get drunk and have some real 
fun — ” 

It went on that way, and sud- 
denly I saw Lucy as she really 
was. Suddenly I realized that 
Gleam had left her mark on me, 
despite her ignorance of social 
ways. In day-to-day close con- 
tact with Gleam’s adult mind, I 
had gone a long way past the 
kids of my own age on the Point. 

Lucy would be fine when she 
grew up a little more. 

After she left, I noted that we 



THE LITTLEST PEOPLE 



63 



had been standing near the spot 
where I had buried the cat Gleam 
had killed many years before. 
Alone in the garden, smoking a 
cigarette, I stared up through the 
Dome at the stars and wondered 
what Gleam was doing that night. 
It was certain that she wasn’t 
worrying about the size of house 
she lived in — Gleam hungered for 
any sort of a shack of her own. 

What would I do if Gleam 
should come this way again? I 
didn’t know. Up until tonight, 
I’d thought I had planned my 
life with Lucy. 

I remembered then that the 
Greater New York Employment 
rocket was due next week, and I 
put out my cigarette and went in, 
a sort of expectant fear surging 
inside. 

■jl/JY father and I were there 
when the rocket landed. Old 
Mott was dead, of course, but 
young Billy Stanger grinned and 
poured the wine, and we sat and 
talked while I leafed through the 
list of names and occupations on 
the printed sheets. Trying to look 
casual, I turned to the “School- 
teachers” section. 

Millicent Hamm leaped out of 
the page at me. 

I kept my voice steady, but I 
couldn’t keep excitement out of it. 

“I need a schoolteacher,” I said. 
I thrust the paper at him. “Try 
this one. I’m sure she’ll be all 



right. I won’t go in the room if 
you don’t mind. Just put her 
through the Converter.” 

Employment people see much, 
say little. Stanger nodded and 
went out. Presently he came out 
of the stock room, carrying some- 
thing in his hand, and went into 
the Converter. I heard the ma- 
chinery squeal and slowly got to 
my feet. The door opened. 

For comfort she was wearing 
briefies of pleasing black and 
white, bootlets, and a ribbon in 
her hair. The eyes were hard and 
suspicious, stuffed with a knowl- 
edge of me. The legs were youth- 
ful and graceful, but there was a 
slight limp. She was tall, a walk- 
ing dream from my memories, 
barely three inches shorter than 
I, moving with assurance and 
poise. 

The Gleam I had made stood 
and stared at the John Blake 
she had made. 

“Well, little boy,” she said in a 
voice that sounded loud because 
I’d always heard it thinner, “I 
see you got trapped in this for- 
lorn dump for the rest of your 
life.” 

“So have you,” I said, walking 
toward her. My father and 
Stanger were staring. 

She raised her arms. Her eyes 
got wet. 

“So have I,” said the new 
Gleam.

queries might require a book. Of

Theory of Relativity” — only eight 
years ago an institute received

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the perfectly serious request from 
a lady to “please send me what 
has been published about avia- 
tion” — but that is not the kind 
I have in mind. I am thinking 
of a short letter that came in 
some time ago and which con-* 
sisted of precisely three sentences. 

In the first sentence, the corre- 
spondent explained that his hobby 
was the making of scale models 
and that a classical chariot was 
the current project. In the sec- 
ond sentence, he said that the 
picture he owned showed seven- 
spoked wheels and could I tell 
him how to construct one. The 
third sentence thanked me for 
whatever help I could give. 

This was easy. I made a sketch 
and said that this would do for 
his purpose, even though the con- 
struction was incorrect mathe- 
matically. Back came the reply 
that it had worked beautifully, 
but why did I say that this con- 
struction was incorrect? He had 
tried it several times and had 
come to the conclusion that the 
“in” in front of “correct” had 
slipped in by mistake. But if it 
hadn’t, why was it incorrect? 

Well, the answer is this column, 
for the simple question requires 
a treatise on the division of the 
circle. 

T ET’S begin with fundamen- 
tals. Using a protractor for 
dividing a circle isn’t permitted — 



in geometry, that is. You can use 
a protractor if you want to cut 
up a pie or to make a wheel 
with a silly number of spokes; 
in short, for practical purposes. 
But in geometry you can use 
only two instruments, a pair of 
compasses and a straight edge. 
Furthermore, the straight edge 
must be used only for connecting 
points, not for measuring dis- 
tances. 

This strict rule has a good rea- 
son, even though beginners often 
have trouble understanding it. 
Ideally, you do all this in your 
head, drawing lines in the air 
with your finger; the lines on 
paper are merely a means of re- 
membering (and communicating) 
what you have found by think- 
ing. The straight lines just show 
which point is supposed to be con- 
nected with which other point. 
The circles “measure” since every 
point along the periphery of a 
circle has the same distance from 
its center. 

A protractor and other mechan- 
ical devices are “forbidden” 
because they will furnish infor- 
mation which did not exist in your 
head first. You are not supposed 
to read off an angle of 30°; you 
are supposed to find it by reason- 
ing. 

For example: the sum of the 
three angles of a triangle is 180°; 
hence, each angle in an equilateral 
triangle must be 60°, and 30° 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



67 



is half of such an angle. Or: a 
right angle is 90°; if I construct 
an equilateral triangle in a right 
angle, the difference between the 
right angle and the triangle 
must be 30°. 

Now let’s go on with the prob- 
lem. Fig. 1 shows the ordinary 
hexagon, constructed, in this case, 
by first halving the circle by 
means of a straight line going 
through its center, and then us- 
ing the compasses with the same 
opening that was used to draw 
the original circle from both ends 
of the diameter, points 2 and 5 in 
the diagram. Or you can do it 
without drawing a diameter first, 
by simply starting at any one 
point of the periphery with the 
compasses and going around. By 
halving the angles, you obtain the 
points for the 12-cornered poly- 
gon. In the diagram, the usual 
method of halving was not used, 
since in this construction you can 
halve one of the 60° angles — the 
one formed by points 1 and 6 
with the center of the circle — by 
erecting a vertical line on the 
diameter. 

By jumping every second point 
of the hexagon, you obtain an 
equilateral triangle, and by do- 
ing this twice in succession, you 
obtain the figure shown in Fig. 2, 
the Star of David (which pro- 
duces a hexagon in its center). 
Another way of arriving at the 
12-cornered polygon is shown in 




Fig. 3. Instead of starting with a 
hexagon and halving every angle, 
you begin with two diameters of 
the circle forming right angles at 
the center. Then you use the com- 
passes with the same opening used 
for the original circle from these 
four points (Nos. 3, 6, 9 and 12 
in the diagram) in the manner 
shown in the right half of the 
diagram. 




68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The result is a figure some- 
times called the Lilac Blossom 
(indicated at points A and B) 
and also the 12 -cornered polygon. 

rriHERE is still another way of 
constructing an equilateral 
triangle in a circle. This consists 
of drawing a radius of the circle, 
halving the radius and erecting 
a vertical line on the halfway 
point. The distance from the half- 
way point to the periphery of 
the circle is one-half of the side 
of the equilateral triangle, in- 
dicated by the points A, 2 and B 
in Fig. 4. 

But it so happens that this half 
side is very nearly the side of a 
7 -cornered polygon. The differ- 
ence is quite small, amounting to 
17/ 10,000th of the radius of the 
circle; if you have a circle with 
a radius of 40 inches, the differ- 
ence is just about 3/32nd of an 
inch. Such an approximation is 
good enough for seven-spoked 
wheels, model or full scale, but 
it is only an approximation. To 
construct the true side of the 7- 
cornered polygon with compasses 
and straight edge is impossible. 
The same holds true for the 9- 
cornered, 11-cornered and 13- 
comered polygon, to mention 
only a few cases. 

Don’t waste your time trying. 
You probably will find approxi- 
mations galore, but no true con- 
struction. 




In fact, there are only q few 
series which can be properly con- 
structed. So far I have dealt with 
the one which I think of as the 
“hexagon series,” which produces, 
beyond the hexagon, polygons 
with 12, 24, 48, 96, etc., corners. 
Another may be called the 
“square series,” which is based on 
the square derived from two di- 
ameters at right angles to each

other (Fig. 5) and leads to poly- 
gons with 8, 16, 32, 64, etc., 
corners. 

Another one is the “pentagon 
series” (Fig. 6 and 7) which, in- 
terestingly enough, does not real- 
ly begin with the pentagon but 
with a 10-comered polygon The 
method is shown in Fig. 6. When 
you draw a smaller circle inside 
the first circle, the diameter of 
the small circle is equal to the 




radius of the large circle. Then 
you connect the center of the 
small circle to the point marked 
“3” in Fig. 6. The distance from 
point 3 to the periphery of the 
small circle is the side of the 10- 
comered polygon. By jumping 
over every second point of the 
10-cornered polygon, you obtain 
the pentagon, and by jumping 
every second point in the penta- 
gon, you obtain the “magic” 
five-pointed star with a smaller 



pentagon in its center (Fig. 7). 
The “pentagon series,” of course, 
leads to polygons with 20, 40, 80, 
160, etc., corners. 

Since a full circle has 360°, the 
angle required for a 15-cornered 
polygon is 24° and that can be 
constructed in an interesting man- 
ner. The angle of the equilateral 
triangle is 60°. The angle of the 
10-cornered polygon is 36°. And 
60 minus 36 = 24. The actual 




Fig. 6 



construction is shown in Fig. 8. 
This naturally leads to polygons 
with 30, 60, 120, etc., corners by 
simple halving of the angles. 

For more than twenty cen- 
turies, these remained the only 
polygons that could be con- 
structed, even though people 
through all these centuries kept 
looking for more. They were espe- 
cially interested in the 7 -cornered 
polygon because seven is sup- 
posedly a magic and holy num- 



70

ber. They also devoted much 
effort to the 9-comered polygon, 
but for no special reason than 
that it just seemed to be simple. 

Nobody, to my knowledge, ever 
wondered whether the possible 
and impossible constructions 
might both be covered by some 
law which one may discover. 

TT was in 1796 — we even know 
the date: March 30th — when 
a 19-year-old student discovered 
that law. His baptismal name was 
Johann Friederich Carl Gauss, 
but later he signed his work Carl 
Friedrich Gauss. 

One of the consequences of the 
discovery was that it was pos- 
sible to construct a 17 -cornered 
polygon. It is not as simple a 
job as the ones discussed. In fact, 
the explanation would take up 
as much room as I have for my 
whole column, so that I can only 
say here where it may be found: 
in F. Klein’s Famous Problems 
of Elementary Geometry (Haf- 
ner, New York, 1950). The 17- 
cornered polygon naturally leads 
to polygons with 34, 68, 136, etc., 
sides, and by using a method 
similar to the one for the 15- 
cornered polygon, you can also 
construct a 51 -cornered polygon 
(from triangle and 17) and an 
85-cornered polygon (from pen- 
tagon and 17). 

Well, what is Gauss’s law? 
What is possible? 




Gauss’s first reasoning was that 
only polygons with an odd 
number of sides need to be con- 
sidered. The even-numbered poly- 
gons are just the result of halving 
angles; the whole “square se- 
quence” works that way, because 
you first halve a full circle, then 
the semi-circle and so forth. 
Gauss then found and proved 
that the odd-numbered polygons 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION

which can be constructed are the 
same as the Fermat primes. 
Therefore you can construct: 

2 1 -f- 1 = 3 (triangle) 

2 2 +1 = 5 (pentagon) 

2* + 1 = 17 

2 s + 1 = 257 

2 10 + 1 = 65,537 

All of them actually have been 
constructed, the last one of this 
series only once. And you can also 
construct odd-numbered polygons 
where the number is the product 
of the multiplication of two Fer- 
mat primes, hence the 15-cor- 
nered polygon (3x5) and the 51 
and 85-cornered polygons (3 x 17 
and 5 x 17, respectively). Like- 
wise the 3 x 2 57 -cornered poly- 
gon, etc., etc., should be possible. 

But 7, 9 and 13 are not. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

How does a living cell know 
when to stop growing? Does the 
action of gravity have anything 
to do with the decision of an 
ameba to split? 

David L. Osborn 
Higashi-Nada Ku 
Kobe City, Japan 

The answer to this question 
is simple, if probably unsatis- 
factory: we do not know. There 
is obviously a complex of fac- 
tors involved that will have to 
be unraveled slowly and pa- 



tiently. Nor is it certain that 
an answer which would apply 
to a cell that is part of a unit 
(say, in the leaf of a tree or in 
the muscle of an animal) would 
also apply to cells that are 
“free,” as, for example, the red 
corpuscles that circulate in our 
blood. 

In the case of the ameba, 
cited by you, one might think 
of gravity as the determining 
factor if the ameba were a dry- 
land creature. But since it lives 
in water, which supports every 
portion of it, all the responsi- 
bility can’t be placed on gravity 
alone. 

I remarked in one of my 
books that one of the biological 
research projects after the com- 
pletion of the space station 
might well be to have unicellu- 
lar plants and animals, like bac- 
teria and amchas, grow in a 
zero-g condition with plenty of 
food around and see what hap- 
pens. I can’t predict what will 
happen, but I do believe that 
whatever is going to happen will 
furnish the main clue for an 
answer to your question. 

The Milky Way stretches from 
the northeast to the southwest. 
Does this give any indication as 
to our position in our galaxy? 
And another question: is the 
plane of the Moon's orbit around 
the Earth constant or does the 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Moon travel in various paths 
around us? 

Irma Anita Jones 
Route I, Box A 
Comanche, Oklahoma 

As to the first question: no. 
But from other observations, it 
has been concluded that our 
sun and its family of planets 
are between two-thirds and 
three-quarters of the total pos- 
sible distance from the center. 
In other words, it is at least 
twice as far from the Sun to 
the center of the Galaxy as 
it is from the Sun to the rim. 

The orbit of the Moon hap- 
pens to l»e unusually compli- 
cated and its calculation ranks 
among the more difficult prob- 
lems. The minimum distance is 
221,463 miles, the maximum 
distance 252,710 miles. The in- 
clination of the plane of the 
Moon's orbit, compared to the 
ecliptic, the plane of the Earth’s 
orbit, also varies. It can be as 
little as 4 degrees and 57 min- 
utes of arc and as much as 5 
degrees 8% minutes of arc. 
This means that there is a kind 
of doughnut-shaped volume of 
space around the Earth which 
contains all the possible posi- 
tions of the Moon. 

I would like to know if the 
planets closer to the Sun rotate 
faster or slower; is there any re- 
lationship between the distance 



from the Sun and the speed of 
rotation of planetary bodies? 

James A. Miller 
2108 S.E. 156 th 
Portland, Oregon 

I wish I could be perfectly 
sure that you actually mean “ro- 
tation” (around the axis) and 
not “revolution” (around the 
Sun). As regards the latter, 
there is a very precise and clear- 
cut relationship between the 
orbital velocity of a planet and 
its distance from the Sun. The 
closer they are to the Sun, the 
faster they move — Kepler’s 
Third Law — the farther away 
from the Sun, the slower. 

For example, Venus proceeds 
at the rate of 21.7 miles per 
second, the Earth moves at 18.5 
miles per second, Mars 15 miles 
per second, Jupiter 8.1 miles 
per second, while Saturn pro- 
ceeds at the comparatively leis- 
urely pace of “only” 6 miles 
per second. 

But there is no relationship 
between the period of rotation 
of a planet and its distance from 
the Sun. 

Mercury, the innermost plan- 
et, completes one rotation in the 
same time it needs for one 
revolution, namely 88 days. The 
rotational period of Venus is 
not known, but it seems to be 
about two of our weeks. Earth 
and Mars have periods of 24 
hours and 24 hours 37 minutes, 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

respectively, while Jupiter, Sat- 
urn and Uranus rotate quite 
fast. The figures are, in the 
same order, 9 hours 55 min- 
utes, 10 hours 14 minutes, and 
10 hours 40 minutes. Neptune 
needs 15 hours and 40 minutes, 
while the rotation of Pluto is as 
yet unknown. 

These figures look as if there 
might he a relationship between 
the size of a planet and its 
diurnal period because Jupiter, 
with an equatorial diameter of 
86,700 miles, is the biggest 
planet and also has the shortest 
period. Saturn, Uranus and 
Neptune are slower in the order 
mentioned, which is also the 
order of decreasing diameters, 
namely 71,500, 32,000 and 
31,000 miles, respectively. Like- 
wise, when you consider the 
inner planets, Earth has a short- 
er diurnal period than either 
Venus, Mars or Mercury, and 
Earth is the biggest of the inner 
planets. 

This sounds like an intrigu- 
ing idea until you look at the 
masses of the planets rather 
than their diameters. Jupiter 
does rotate faster than Saturn, 
the difference being 20 min- 
utes. But Jupiter’s mass is equal 



to 317 Earth masses, while Sat- 
urn’s is equal to 95 Earth 
masses. Saturn rotates faster 
than Uranus (25 minutes differ- 
ence), but the difference in 
mass between these two is even 
more impressive, for Uranus 
has only 14.7 Earth masses. 
Neptune needs 5 hours more 
than Uranus, but while the 
handbook will tell you that 
Uranus has a somewhat larger 
diameter than Neptune, the 
same handbook will tell you 
that Neptune is the more mas- 
sive of the two, having 17.2 
Earth masses. 

That these differences in ro- 
tational period are not in pro- 
portion to the differences in 
mass is especially clear in the 
case of the inner planets. In 
round figures, Earth is ten 
times as massive as Mars, yet 
the Martian period is only 37 
minutes longer. 

In short, there is no relation- 
ship between period of rota- 
tion and distance from the Sun, 
but in general it may be said 
that, at least in our solar sys- 
tem, the more massive planets 
tend to rotate faster than the 
lighter ones.

would ordinarily be honored to 
meet and, in due course of time, 
betroth. But surely you will ad- 
mit that her family — ” there was 
the faintest inhalation through 
the fragile nose — “particularly 
on the male side, is not one which 
could be accepted into our own.” 
Her expression was genuinely re- 
gretful. 

“More explicitly, her father’s 
opinion on the proper conduct of 
a domicile . .” The sniff was 
more audible. “Then too, his be- 
havior in accord with that opin- 
ion is such that our entire family 
would be embroiled in an endless 
series of affairs of Integrity. You, 
yourself, would be forced to bear 
the brunt of these encounters, as 
well as the responsibility of de- 
fending the notoriously untenable 
properties which Mr. Holland' 
pleases to designate as Barbara’s 
dowry. 

“No, Cottrell, I fear that, much 
as this match may appeal to you 
superficially, you must realize 
that the responsibilities entailed 
would more than offset any pos- 
sible benefits.” Her hand patted 
his lightly. “I’m sorry.” A tear 
sparkled in each eye, and it was 
obvious that the discussion had 
been a great strain upon her, for 
she genuinely loved her son. 

Cottrell sighed. “All right, 
Mother,” he said. There was 
nothing more he could do at 
this time. “But should circum- 



stances change you will reconsid- 
er, won’t you?” he asked. 

H IS mother smiled and nod- 
ded, as she said, “Of course, 
Cottrell.” But then the smile fad- 
ed. “However, it does seem rather 
unlikely, doesn’t it? Are there 
no other young ladies . .?” At 
his expression, the smile returned, 
and her voice became reassuring. 
“Well, we’ll see, we’ll see.” 
“Thank you, Mother.” At 
least, he had that much. He rose 
from his chair and kissed her 
cheek. “I have to make sure the 
cows have all been stalled.” 

With a final smile he left her, 
hurrying across the yard to the 
barn. The cows were all attended 
to, of course, but he stayed in 
the barn, driving his work-hard- 
ened fist into a grain sack again 
and again, while sweat beaded 
his forehead. 

Feeling slightly ill, he gently 
closed the barn door behind him 
and sensed from the hues of the 
sunset and the feel of the wind 
that it would be a clear night. 
The realization filled him with 
equal parts of guilt and antici- 
pation. 

npHE temperature was just 
-*■ right and the dew had left a 
perfect leavening of dampness in 
the darkness. Cott let the false 
door close quietly behind him 
and slipped noiselessly across the

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



moist lawn at an angle that 
brought him out on the clay 
road, precisely at the point where 
his property ended and Mr. Hol- 
land’s began. 

He walked through the dark- 
ness with gravel shifting under 
his moccasins, his bandoleer 
bumping gently against his body, 
with the occasional feel of oily 
metal against his cheek as the 
carbine, slung from his shoulder, 
touched him with its curved 
magazine. It was a comforting 
sensation — his father had felt it 
before him, and his father’s fa- 
ther. It had been the mark of a 
free man for each of them. 

When he had come as close to 
Mr. Holland’s house as he could 
without disturbing the dog, he 
slid into the ditch that ran beside 
the road. Cradling his carbine in 
the crooks of his bent arms, he 
belly-crawled silently and rapid- 
ly as close to the house as the 
ditch would take him. 

He raised his head from behind 
a clump of weeds he had planted 
during a spring rainstorm and, 
using this as cover, scanned the 
front of the house. For any of 
this to be possible without the 
dog’s winding him, the breeze had 
to be just right. On this night, it 
was. 

The parlor window — perhaps 
the only surface-level parlor win- 
dow in this area, he thought — 
was lighted, and she was in the 



room. Cott checked the sharp 
sound of his breath and sank his 
teeth against his lower lip. He 
kept his hands carefully away 
from the metalwork of his car- 
bine, for his palms were sweaty. 

He waited until, finally, she 
put out the light and went down- 
stairs to bed. Then he dropped his 
head on his folded arms for a 
moment, eyes closed and breath 
irregular, before he twisted 
around and began to crawl back 
up the ditch. 

Tonight, so soon after what his 
mother had said, he was shocked, 
but not truly surprised, to dis- 
cover that his vision was badly 
blurred. 

He reached the point where it 
was safe to leave the ditch and 
stood up quietly. He put one foot 
on the road and sprang up to the 
clay surface with the agility of 
young muscles. There was no 
warning of a darker shadow 
among the dappled splotches 
thrown by roadside weeds and 
bushes. 

Mr. Holland calmly said, “Hi. 
boy.” 

T OWERING his shoulder, Cott 
" was ready to let the carbine 
he had just reslung slide down 
his arm into his hand. He stood 
motionless, peering at Holland, 
who had stepped up silently. 

“Mr. Holland!” 

The old man chuckled. 



IRONCLAD 



79 




“Weren’t expecting me, huh?" 

Cott took a measure of relief 
from the man’s obvious lack of 
righteous anger. “Good — uh — 
good evening, sir," he mumbled. 
Apparently he was not going to 
die immediately, but there was 
no telling what was going on in 
his neighbor’s mind. 

“Guess I was right about that 
patch of weeds springing up kind 
of sudden.” Holland said. 

Cott felt the heat rush into 
his ears, but he said, “Weeds, 
sir?” 

“Pretty slick. You got the 
makings of a damn good combat 
man.” 

Cott was thankful for the dark- 
ness, as one embarrassment was 
replaced by another. The lack 
of light, however, did not keep 
his voice from betraying more 
than it should. Holland’s im- 
plication had been clear. “My 
family, sir, prefers not to ac- 
knowledge former members who 
have sunk below their station. 
You will understand that under 
differing circumstances, I might 
thus consider your remark to be 
not flattering.” 

Holland chuckled. “No insult 
intended, son. There was a time 
when a guy like you wouldn’t 
have stopped strutting for a 
week, after a pat on the back like 
that.” 

Cott could still feel the heat in 
his cheeks, and its cause over- 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rode his sharp sense of the in- 
congruity of this midnight debate, 
a completely illogical circum- 
stance which any other two men 
would have settled in a normal 
and civilized manner. 

“Fortunately, sir,” his voice 
was now at its normal pitch, “we 
no longer live in such times.” 

“ You don’t, maybe.” Holland’s 
voice was somewhat testy. 

“I sincerely hope not, sir.” 

Holland made an impatient 
sound. “Boy, your Uncle Jim 
was the best damned rifleman 
that ever took out a patrol. Any 
family that gets snotty notions 
about being better than him . 
Oh, mercy!" 

Cott recoiled from the curse. 
"Sir!" 

“Excuse me,” Holland said 
sarcastically. “I forgot we’re liv- 
ing in refined times. Not too re- 
fined, though, for a man to go 
crawling through ditches to sneak 
a look at a gal reading a book!” 
he added with contempt. 

/^OTT felt adrenalin sweep 
^ through his bloodstream. At 
any moment, Mr. Holland was 
obviously going to exercise his 
right to call an affair of Integrity. 
Even while he formulated the 
various points for and against a 
right on his part to defend him- 
self, even if surprised in so pal- 
pably immoral an action, his 
reflexes let the carbine slip down 



his shoulder and hang pre- 
cariously from the sling which, 
despite careful oiling, now gave 
a perverse creak. Cott set his 
teeth in annoyance. 

“I haven’t got a gun on you, 
boy,” Mr. Holland said placidly. 
“There’s better ways of protect- 
ing your Integrity than shooting 
people.” 

Cott had long since decided 
that his neighbor — like all the 
old people who had been born 
in the Wild Sixties and grown 
up through the Dirty Years — 
was, to put it politely, unconven- 
tional. But the sheer lack of 
common sense about going un- 
armed into a situation where 
one’s Integrity might be molest- 
ed was more than unconvention- 
ality. 

But that was neither here nor 
there. In such a case, the greater 
responsibility in carrying out the 
proprieties was obviously his to 
assume. “Allow me to state the 
situation clearly, sir,” he said, 
“in order that there be no mis- 
understanding.” 

“No misunderstanding, son. 
Not about this situation, anyway. 
Hell, when I was your — ” 

“Nevertheless,” Cott interpos- 
ed, determined not to let Mr. 
Holland trap himself into a gen- 
uine social blunder, “the fact 
remains that I have trespassed 
on your property for a number 
of years — ” 



RONCLAD

“ — for the purpose of peeping 
at Barbara,” Holland finished for 
him. “Do me a favor, son?” Hol- 
land’s voice was slightly touched 
by amusement. 

“Certainly, sir.” 

“Lay off the — ” Holland caught 
himself. “I mean show a little 
less concern for the social ameni- 
ties. Ease up on this business of 
doing the right thing, come hell 
or high water. Here — let’s sit 
down and let’s talk over a few 
things.” 

He was neither hung nor par- 
doned. Cott’s nerves had edged 
to the breaking point. 

This final gaucherie was too 
much for him. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” he said, his 
voice harsher than he intended, 
“but that’s out of the question. 
I suggest you either do your duty 
as head of your family, or else 
acknowledge your unwillingness 
to do so.” 

“Why?” 

The question was not as sur- 
prising as it might have been, had 
it come at the beginning of this 
fantastic scene. But it served to 
crystalize one point. It was not 
meant as a defiant insult, Cott 
realized. It was a genuine, sin- 
cere inquiry. The fact that Hol- 
land was incapable of appreciat- 
ing the answer was proof that 
his mother’s advice had been 
correct. Holland was not a gentle- 
man. 



Q UITE obviously, there was 
only one course open to him 
now, if he were not to abandon 
all hope for Barbara’s hand. In- 
credible as it might seem, it was 
to answer the question in all 
seriousness, in an attempt to 
force some understanding through 
the long-set habits of Mr. Hol- 
land’s thinking. 

“I should think it hardly nec- 
essary to remind you that a per- 
son’s Integrity is his most prized 
moral possession. In this particu- 
lar case, I have violated your 
daughter’s Integrity and, as a 
result, that of your family, as 
well.” Cott shook his head in the 
darkness. Explain he might, but 
his voice was sign enough of his 
outrage. 

“What’s that?” Holland’s own 
voice was wearing thin. 

“I beg your pardon, sir?” 
“Integrity, damn it! Give me 
the definition.” 

“Everyone knows what Integ- 
rity is, sir! That is, everyone 
should know.” Cott’s temper was 
foaming. 

Holland swore in frustration. 
“Can’t verbalize it, but you’ll 
cut another man down for it. Or 
expect to be cut down. All right! 
Go ahead, but don’t expect me to 
help you make a damned fool 
of yourself.” He sighed. “Go on 
home, son. Maybe, in about 
twenty years or so, you’ll get up 
enough guts to come and knock 



82

on the door like a man, if you 
want to see Barbara.” 

Through the occlusion of his 
almost overwhelming rage, Cott 
realized that now he could not 
say anything further which might 
offend Holland. “I’m certain 
that, if I were to do so, Miss 
Barbara would not receive me,” 
he finally managed to say in an 
even voice, gratified at his ability 
to do so. 

“No, she probably wouldn’t,” 
Holland said bitterly. “She’s too 
damn well brought up— thanks 
to those merciful aunts of hers!” 
He turned his back like a 
coward and strode off down the 
road. 

Cott stood alone in the night, 
his hands clenching his bando- 
leer, grinding the looped cart- 
ridges together. Then he turned 
on his heel and loped home. 

II 

f'T'HE shadow coming events 
cast before them is pale com- 
pared to the umbra they leave 
behind them. It was a full gen- 
eration since Berendtsen had 
marched his men across the face 
of North America, like a harrow 
that broke the hard root-clumps 
of isolated and fiercely indepen- 
dent survivors, and left the sys- 
tematized ground ready and 
fertile for civilization’s replant- 
ing. 



It was two generations since 
men had fought from house to 
house in New York, while snipers 
waited patiently at apartment 
windows for the rich target of 
a man — any man whose knap- 
sack might contain priceless am- 
munition and perhaps, if the 
hunter was lucky, food looted 
from the canned-goods shelves of 
some not-quite-completely-gut- 
ted store. 

It was a full three generations 
since the war nobody won, when 
the grime of Manhattan was re- 
placed by a deadlier dust that 
glowed softly in the night, that 
lurked avidly outside the few 
populated caves which remained 
in the agonized cliffs of Man- 
hattan. 

So Cott, as he ran for the only 
place where there was peace for 
him — toward the Integrity of his 
home — was only four generations 
removed from civilization, from 
the warm glow of light through 
farmhouse windows on soft nights 
in the summertime. But he was 
only three generations removed 
from a frightened, snarling, hunt- 
ing and looting organism that 
crouched in a corner of its par- 
quet-floored cave and fipgered 
the bolt of its ever-present wea- 
pon. 

He left his rifle on the family 
arms-rack in the front parlor 
and padded about the surface 
floor, resetting the alarms, inter- 



IRONCLAD 



rupting himself occasionally, 
muscles tensed as he thought of 
what had happened. The incred- 
ible complexity of the problem 
overwhelmed him, presenting no 
clear face which he could attack 
and rationalize logically. 

Primarily, of course, the fault 
was his. He had committed a pre- 
meditated breach of Integrity. It 
was in its various ramifications 
that the question lost its clarity. 

He had spied on Barbara Hol- 
land repeatedly. Her father had 
become aware of the fact. To- 
night, instead of issuing a direct 
challenge, Mr. Holland had lain 
in wait for him. Then, having in- 
formed Cott that he was aware of 
his guilt, Mr. Holland not only 
had not done the gentlemanly 
thing, but had ridiculed his ex- 
pectation of it. Parenthetically, 
the man had insulted Cott and 
his family, and had derided his 
own daughter. He had referred 
to his sisters-in-law in an unbe- 
coming manner which, if made 
public, would have called for a 
bandoleer-flogging at the hands 
of the male members of the fe- 
male line. 

Nevertheless, whether Mr. Hol- 
land was a gentleman or not, 
Cott had been guilty of a serious 
offense. And in Cott’s mind, as 
in that of every other human 
being, what had been a twinging 
secret shame shone disastrous 
and disgusting as a public horror. 



Since Holland had refused to 
solve the problem for him in the 
conventional manner, Cott was 
left with his shame. 

Finally, Cott walked noiseless- 
ly down to the living quarters, 
uncertain of the degree of his 
guilt and, therefore, the extent 
of his disgrace. Knowing he 
would not be able to sleep no 
matter how long he lay on his 
bed, he fought down that part 
of his mind which recalled glow- 
ingly the image of Barbara Hol- 
land. 

THOUGHT — but lost. The re- 
membered picture was as 
strong as the others he had plac- 
ed beside it, beginning with the 
first one five years ago when 
Cott had first passed her window, 
on his return from Graduate 
training. And, though he saw her 
almost daily at the post office or 
store, these special images were 
not obscured by the cold and 
proper aloofness with which she 
surrounded herself when she was 
not — he winced — alone. 

Again, there was the app&lling 
problem of Barbara’s father. The 
man had been raised in the wild 
immorality and casual circum- 
stances of the Dirty Years. Ob- 
viously, he could see nothing 
wrong with what Cott had been 
doing. He had had enough sense 
not to tell anyone else about it — 
thank the good Lord — but, in 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



some blundering attempt to 
“Get you two kids together,” or 
whatever he might call it, what 
would he tell Barbara? 

Dawn came, and Cott welcom- 
ed the night’s end. 

As head of the family since his 
father’s death in an affair of 
Integrity two years before — he 
had, of course, been the Party 
at Grievance — it was Cott’s duty 
to plan each day’s activities when 
they varied from normal farm 
routine. Today, with all the 
spring work done and the sum- 
mer chores so light as to be in- 
significant, he was at loose ends 
— yet he was grateful for this 
opportunity to bury himself in a 
problem with which he had been 
trained to cope. 

He devoted an hour’s thinking 
to it and finally fell back on 
what, in retrospect, had been a 
device his father had used. If 
there was nothing else, there was 
always Drill. 

Out of consideration for his 
grandmother’s age, he waited un- 
til 07 :58 before he touched the 
alarm stud. But not even the 
heavy slam of shutters being 
hurled into their places in the 
armor plate of the outer walls, 
the screech of the generator as 
the radar antennae came out of 
their nocturnal half -sleep into 
whirling life, or the clatter of 
the household children firing test 
bursts from their machine guns 



was enough to disturb his brood- 
ing. 

The Drill lasted until 10:00. 
By then, it was obvious that the 
household defenses were doing 
everything they were designed for 
and that the members of the 
household knew their assign- 
ments perfectly. Even his grand- 
mother’s legendary skill with her 
range finder had not grown dull. 
There was a distinct possibility 
that she had memorized the 
range of every likely target in 
the area. That, if true, was not an 
evasion of her duties, but a valu- 
able accomplishment. 

“Very good,” Cott said over 
the intercommunications system. 
“All members of the household 
are now free to return to their 
normal duties, except the chil- 
dren, who will report to me for 
training.” 

His mother, whose battle sta- 
tion was at the radarscope a few 
feet away from him, smiled her 
approval as she returned the 
switches to Auto Survey. She put 
her hand gently on his forearm 
as he rose from the fire control 
chair. 

“I’m glad, Cottrell — very 
glad,” she said, smiling. 

He did not, at first, understand 
what she meant and looked at her 
blankly. 

“I was afraid you might be 
growing neglectful of your duties, 
as so many of our neighbors are 



IRONCLAD 



85 



doing,” she explained. ‘‘But I 
should not have doubted you.” 
Her voice was strongly underlaid 
with pride in him. “Your fiber 
is stronger than that. Why, I 
was even afraid that your disap- 
pointment after our little talk 
yesterday might distract you. 
But I was wrong, and you’ll 
never know how happy I am that 
you didn’t permit it.” 

He bent to kiss her, then hur- 
ried to the parlor, where the 
children had already assembled 
and taken their weapons out of 
the arms-rack. 

¥> Y mid-afternoon, the younger 
children had been excused, 
and only his two oldest brothers 
were out on the practice terrain 
with him. 

“Stay down!" Cott shouted at 
Alister. “You’ll never live to 
graduate if you won’t learn to 
flatten out at the crest of a rise!” 
He flung his carbine up to his 
cheek and snapped a branch be- 
side his brother’s rump to prove 
his point. 

“Now, you.” He whirled on 
Geoffrey. “How’d I estimate my 
windage? Quick!” 

“Grass,” Geoffrey said laconi- 
cally. 

“Wrong! You haven’t been 
over that ground in two weeks. 
You have no accurate idea -how 
much wind will move that grass 
as much as it’s doing.” 



"Asked me how you did it,” 
Geoffrey pointed out. 

“All right,” Cott snapped, 
“score one for you. Now, how 
would you do it?” 

“Feel. Watch me.” Geoffrey’s 
lighter weapon cracked with a 
noise uncannily like that of the 
branch, which now split at a 
point two inches below where 
Cott’s heavy slug had broken it 
off. 

“Have an instinct for it, do 
you?” Cott was perversely glad 
to find an outlet for his annoy- 
ance. “Do it again.” 

Geoffrey shrugged. He fired 
twice. The branch splintered, and 
there was a shout from Alister. 
Cott blinked at Geoffrey. “You 
put it next to his hand. Guess he 
got some dirt in his face too.” 
Cott looked at the point where 
the grass was undulating wildly, 
as Alister tried to roll away under 
its cover. He found time to note 
his brother’s clumsiness before 
he said, “You couldn’t have seen 
his hand — or anything except the 
top of his rump, for that matter.” 
Geoffrey’s seventeen-year-old 
face was secretly amused. “I just 
figured, if I was Alis, where 
would I keep my hands? Simple.” 
Cott could feel the challenge to 
his pre-eminence as the family’s 
fighting man gathering thickly 
about him. “Very good,” he said 
coldly. “You have an instinct 
for combat. Now, suppose that 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had been a defective cartridge — 
bad enough to tumble to the 
right and kill your brother. What 
then?” 

“I hand-loaded those cases 
myself. Think I’m fool enough 
to trust that ham-handed gun- 
smith at the store?” Geoffrey 
was impregnable. Cott felt the 
strain of controlling his temper. 

“If you’re so good, why don’t 
you go off and join the Militia?” 

|^EOFFREY took the insult 
without expression. “Think 
I’ll stick around. You’re going to 
need help — if old man Holland 
ever catches you on those little 
moonlight strolls of yours.” 

Cott’s anger was mounting. 
“What — did — you- — say?” The 

words emerged from his throat 
like bullets. 

“You heard me.” Geoffrey put 
a bullet to either side of the 
thrashing Alister, then one above 
and one below. Alister’s training 
broke completely and he sprang 
out of the grass and began to 
run, shouts choking his throat. 
“A rabbit,” Geoffrey said con- 
temptuously. “Just pure rabbit. 
Me, I’ve got Uncle Jim’s blood, 
but that Alis, he’s genuine Moth- 
er.” He fired again and snapped 
the heel from Alister’s shoe. As 
Alister stumbled into the ground, 
Cott’s open palm smashed against 
the side of Geoffrey’s face. 

Geoffrey took two sideward 



steps and stopped, his eyes wide 
with shock. The gun hung limply 
from his hands. It would still 
be several years before he would 
have raised it. 

“You’ll never mention that rel- 
ative’s name again!” Cott said 
thickly. “Not to me, not to any- 
one else. What’s more, you’ll 
consider it a breach of Integrity 
if anyone speaks of him in your 
presence. That understood? As 
for your fantasies about myself 
and Mr. Holland, if you mention 
that again, you’ll learn there- is 
such a thing as a breach of 
Integrity between brothers!” But 
he knew that everything he said 
was as much an admission as a 
shouted confession. He could 
feel the night’s sickness seeping 
through his system again, turn- 
ing his muscles into limp rags 
and sending the blood pounding 
through his ears. 

Geoffrey narrowed his eyes. 
“For a guy that hates armies and 
soldiers, you sure act like a top 
sergeant,” he said. He turned 
around and began to stride away, 
then stopped and looked back. 
“And I’d drop you before you 
got the lead out of your pants,” 
he added. 

Geoffrey knows, echoed through 
Cott’s mind. Geoffrey knows, 
and Mr. Holland found me out. 
How many others? Like a sick- 
ening refrain, the thoughts tum- 
bled over and over in his skull, 



IRONCLAD 



87 



while he swung down the road 
with rapid and clumsy strides. 
The coordination of all the mus- 
cles of his usually lithe body was 
non-functioning, thanks to the 
shock of what he had learned on 
the practice terrain. 

He pictured Geoffrey, watching 
from a window and snickering as 
Cott crawled along the ditch. 
He seemed to hear Mr. Holland’s 
dry chuckle. How many other 
neighbors had, over the last three 
years, seen him? When he 
thought of it, it seemed incredible 
that pure chance had not made 
the entire countryside aware of 
his disgraceful actions. 

But he could not run from it. 
It was not the way a man faced 
situations. He should go to the 
club and watch the faces of the 
men. As they would greet him, 
they’d hide a little hidden 
demon of scorn in their eyes. 

The carbine’s butt slapped his 
thigh as he climbed the club 
steps. 

Ill 

TIE could not be sure he had 
found it. Looking down at 
the newly refilled mug of rum, 
he understood this. He could not 
deny that a strange perverse de- 
sire to see what was not really 
there might have put an im- 
agined edge on the twinkle in 
Winter’s eye, or the undercur- 



rent of mirth that always ac- 
cented Olsen's voice. If Hollis 
sneered more than usual, it prob- 
ably meant nothing more than 
that the man had discovered 
some new quality about himself 
that made him better than his 
fellows. Just probably, probably 
— with nothing certain. Neither 
affirmation nor denial. 

Cott’s hand closed around the 
mug, and he scalded his throat 
with the drink. The remembered 
visions of Barbara were attaining 
a greater precision with every 
swallow. 

“Hello, boy.” 

Oh, my God! he thought. He 
had forgotten that Holland was 
a member of the club. He watch- 
ed Mr. Holland slip into the seat 
opposite nis and wondered how 
many dry chuckles had accom- 
panied the old man’s relating 
last night’s events. 

“How do you do, sir,” he man- 
aged to say, remembering to 
maintain the necessary civilities. 

“Don’t mind if I work on my 
liquor at the same table with 
you, do you?” 

Cott shook his head. “Pleasure, 
sir.” 

The chuckle came that Cott 
had been expecting. “Say, boy, 
if you’d pour a few slugs into 
you, you’d forget to tack on some 
of that fancy speech.” Mr. Hol- 
land chuckled again. 

“Guess I got a little sore at 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you last night,” he went on. 
“Sorry about that. Everybody’s 
got a right to live the way they 
want to.” 

Cott stared silently into his 
mug. The clarity that had be- 
gun to emerge from its depths 
was now unaccountably gone, as 
though Holland’s presence was 
enough to plunge him headlong 
back into the mental chaos that 
had strangled his thinking 
through the night and most of 
the day. He was no longer sure 
that Mr. Holland had not kept 
the story to himself. He was no 
longer sure that Geoffrey had 
done more than make a shrewd 
guess ... he was no longer sure 
of anything. 

“Look, boy . .” 

And the thought came that, 
for the first time since he had 
known him, Mr. Holland was as 
unsure as he. He looked up, saw 
the slow light of uncertainty in 
the man’s glance. “Yes, sir?” 
“Boy — I don’t know. I tried to 
talk to you last night, but I 
guess we were both kind of 
steamed up. Think you’ll feel 
more like listening tonight? Par- 
ticularly if I choose my words 
a little carefully?” 

“Certainly, sir.” That, at least, 
was common courtesy. 

"Well, look — I was a friend of 
your Uncle Jim’s.” 

Cott bristled. “Sir, I . .” He 
stopped. In a sense, he was obli- 



gated to Mr. Holland. If he 
didn’t say it now, it would have 
to be said later. “Sorry, sir, 
please go on.” 

TI/JR. Holland nodded. “We 
campaigned with Berendtsen 
together, sure. That doesn’t sit 
too well with some people around 
here. But it’s true, and there’re 
lots of people who remember it, 
so there’s nothing wrong with my 
saying it. 

“Jim was Matt Garvin’s oldest 
son,” Mr. Holland went on. “You 
can be proud of your grand- 
father, boy. He held half of New 
York’s East Side together, after 
the war. You’ve been taught 
about that. How they were killing 
each other for the sake of their 
ammunition, and how the women 
either had to stick close to their 
men everywhere they went, or 
else learn to fight as well as the 
men. It was Matt Garvin who 
changed all that, from Twenty- 
third Street down to the Battery, 
all along the east side of Broad- 
way. By the time some of those 
women had yearling kids, they 
could walk around outside in the 
daytime. 

“One of those kids was Jim, 
I was another, and Ted Berendt- 
sen was a third. When Ted 
started forming the Army of Uni- 
fication, Jim and I went along 
with him.” 

Something that was half-reflex 



IRONCLAD 



89 



twisted Cott’s mouth at the men- 
tion of the A.U. 

“It had to be done the way it 
was, Cott,” Mr. Holland said. 
“How else was Ted going to get 
a central government started 
among a bunch of forted-up 
farmers and lone-wolf nomads? 
Beat ’em individually at check- 
ers? We needed a government — 
and fast, before we ran out of 
cartridges for the guns and went 
back to spears and arrows.” 

“They didn’t have to do it 
their way,” Cott said bitterly. 

Mr. Holland sighed. “Devil 
they didn’t. Besides, do you know 
exactly how it was done? Were 
you there?” 

“My mother and father were. 
My mother remembers very 
well,” Cott answered. Strange, 
how his fingers could wrap 
around the mug so tightly, yet 
no warning of the strain on bone 
and muscle got through to his 
brain. 

“Yeah,” Mr. Holland said dry- 
ly, “your mother was always good 
at remembering. Does she re- 
member Jim’s passing the land 
on to your father after Berendt- 
sen gave it to him?” 

Cott nodded. “Yes, sir, she 
does. She also remembers my 
uncle leading the group that wip- 
ed out her family, so that Ber- 
endtsen would have the land to 
give.” 

“I wasn’t there, son, but the 



way I heard it, her folks were 
from Pennsylvania. What were 
they doing, holding down Jersey 
land?” He paused. 

“Look, boy, it wasn’t any- 
body’s land. Her folks could 
have kept it, if they’d had any 
sense. They should’ve realized 
that all Ted wanted was for them 
to agree to take orders from him 
for a while, until there could be 
an election. And none of that 
kept her from marrying Bob Gar- 
vin.” 

C OTT took a deep breath. “My 
father, sir, never fought with 
Berendtsen. He was the youngest 
of Matt Garvin’s children, and 
he struck out for himself after 
his father died. He was a free 
man, with a sense of Integrity 
that did not permit him to take 
someone else’s orders.” 

“He was also pretty good with 
that carbine. Might have had 
something to do with it.” 

“It might have, sir,” Cott 
agreed, welcoming the feeling of 
pride that forced out some of 
his uncertainty. 

Holland nodded. “He was the 
one who started this household 
defense business around here, 
wasn’t he? Figured if a carbine 
could keep him free, an armored 
bunker could fence off his land 
and protect his whole family. 
Which wasn’t a bad idea,” he 
added. “Berendtsen unified this 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



country, but he didn’t exactly 
clean it up. That was more of a 
job than a man could do in one 
lifetime.” 

Holland drained his mug, put 
it down and wiped his mouth. 
“But, boy, don’t you think those 
days are the past? Don’t you 
think it’s time we came out of the 
hedgehog houses and out of this 
hedgehog Integrity business?” 

Mr. Holland put his palms on 
the table and caught Cott’s eyes 
with his own. “Don’t you think 
it’s time we finished the unifying 
job and got us a community 
where a boy can walk up to his 
neighbor’s house in broad day- 
light, knock on the door and say 
hello to a girl if he wants to?” 

Cott had been listening with 
tangled emotions. But Holland’s 
last words stung him and, once 
again, the thought of what had 
happened the previous night was 
laid bare, and all of his self-dis- 
gust with it. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” he said, “but 
I fear we have differing views on 
the subject. A man’s home is his 
defense, and his Integrity and 
that of his family is what keeps 
that defense strong and inviolate. 
The code by which we live is 
one which has evolved for the 
fulfillment of the vital requisites 
for freedom. If we abandon it, 
we go back to the Dirty Years. 
And I’m afraid, sir — ” he shud- 
dered at remembrance of the out- 



rage he had felt the previous 
night — “that despite your best 
efforts, I will still marry your 
daughter honorably or not at 
all.” 

Holland shook his head and 
smiled faintly. Cott realized how 
foolish that last sentence had 
sounded. Nevertheless, while he 
could not stem his impulses, he 
felt perfectly aware of the dif- 
ference between right and wrong. 

Holland stood up. “All right, 
boy. You stick to your system. 
Only — it doesn’t seem to work so 
well for you, does it?” 

Once again, Mr. Holland turn- 
ed around and walked away, 
leaving Cott with nothing to say 
or do, with no foundation of as- 
surance. It was worse than any 
insult. 

TTIS footsteps were unsteady as 
he ' crossed the club floor. 
The rum, combined with his 
sleepless night, had settled into 
a weight at the base of his skull. 
He was about to open the door 
when Chuck Kittredge laid a 
hand on his arm. 

“How do you do, Garvin?” 
Kittredge said. 

Cott smiled. Chuck was his 
neighbor on the side away from 
Mr. Holland. “How do you do?” 
“You look a little tired,” 
Chuck remarked. 

“I am, Kittredge.” 

“Shouldn’t wonder — with you 



IRONCLAD

holding Drill right at dawn.” 
Cott shrugged. “Have to keep 
the defenses in shape, you know.” 
Kittredge laughed. “Why, for 
Pete’s sake? Or were you just re- 
hearsing for the Fourth?” 

Cott frowned. “Why — no, of 
course not. I’ve heard you hold- 
ing Drill often enough.” 

His neighbor nodded. “Sure — 
whenever one of the kids has a 
birthday. But you don’t really 
mean you were holding a genu- 
ine, dead-serious affair?” 

Cott was having a little trouble 
concentrating. He squinted and 
shook his head slightly. “What’s 
the matter with that?” 

Kittredge’s voice and manner 
became more serious. “Oh, now 
look, Garvin, there’s been noth- 
ing for us to defend against in 
fifteen years. Matter of fact, I’m 
thinking of dismounting my ar- 
tillery entirely.” 

Cott looked at him uncompre- 
hendingly. “You can’t be seri- 
ous!” 

Kittredge returned the look. 
“Sure.” 

“But you can’t. They’d be out 
of machinegun range, and they’d 
shell you to fragments with mor- 
tars and fieldpieces. They’d 
knock out your machinegun tur- 
rets, close in under their rifle 
cover and lob grenades into your 
living quarters.” 

Kittredge laughed. He slapped 
his hand against his thigh while 



his shoulders shook. “Who the 
devil is 'they?’ he gasped. “Ber- 
endtsen?” 

Cott felt the first touch of 
anger as it penetrated the dead- 
ening blanket that had wrapped 
itself around his thoughts. 

Kittredge was still chuckling. 
“Come off it, will you, Cott? As 
a matter of fact, while I wasn’t 
going to mention it, all that 
banging at your place this morn- 
ing practically ruined one of my 
cows. Ran head-on into a fence. 
It’s not the first time it’s hap- 
pened, either. The only reason 
I’ve never said anything before 
is because your own livestock 
probably has just as bad a time 
of it. 

“Look, Cott, we’re farmers. 
Farmers can’t afford to unnerve 
their livestock and poison their 
land. It was fine while it was the 
only way we could operate at all, 
but the most hostile thing seen 
around here since Berendtsen’s 
death was a chicken hawk.” 

The anger turned into genuine 
rage. Cott could feel it settling 
into the pit of his stomach and 
vibrating at his fingertips. “So 
you’re asking me to stop holding 
Drill, is that it?” 

K ITTREDGE recognized the 
rasping note, and frowned. 
“Not a/together, Cott. Not if you 
don’t want to. But I wish you’d 
save it for celebrations.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“The weapons of my house- 
hold aren’t firecrackers!” 

“Aw, come on, Cott!” 

For almost twenty-four hours, 
Cott had been encountering situ- 
ations to which there were no 
solutions in his experience. He 
was baffled, frustrated, angry. 
The carbine was off his shoulder 
and in his hands with the speed 
and smoothness of motion that 
his father had drilled into him 
until it was beyond impediment 
by exhaustion or alcohol. 

“Charles Kittredge, I charge 
you with attempt to breach the 
Integrity of my household. Load 
and fire.” 

The formula, too, was as in- 
grained in Cott as was his whole 
way of life. Chuck Kittredge 
knew it as well as he did. He 
blanched. 

“You gone crazy?” It was a 
new voice, from slightly beyond 
and beside Chuck. Cott’s surpris- 
ed glance flicked over and saw 
Chuck’s younger brother, Mich- 
ael. 

“Do you stand with him?” 
Cott’s voice rapped out. 

“Aw, now look, Cott,” Chuck 
Kittredge said, “you’re not seri- 
ous about this?” 

“Stand or turn your back.” 
"Cott/ All I said was — ” 

“Am I to understand that you 
are attempting to explain your- 
self?” 

Michael Kittredge moved for- 



ward. “What’s the matter with 
you, Garvin? You living in the 
Dirty Years or something?” 
The knot of fury in Cott’s 
stomach twisted itself tighter. 
“That’ll be far enough. I asked 
you — do you stand with him?” 
“No, he doesn’t!” Chuck Kit- 
tredge said violently. “And I 
don’t stand either. What kind of 
damned foolishness is this, any- 
way? People don’t just pull chal- 
lenges at the drop of a hat like 
that any more!” 

“That’s for each man to decide 
for himself,” Cott answered. “Do 
you turn your back?” 

A N ugly flush flamed in Chuck 
Kittredge’s cheekbones. 
“Damned if I will.” His mouth 
clamped into an etched white 
line. “All right, Cott, who goes 
through the door first, you or 
me?” 

“Nobody will go anywhere. 
You’ll stand or turn where you 
are.” 

“Right here, in the club ? You 
are crazy!” 

“You chose the place, not I. 
Load and fire.” 

Chuck Kittredge put his hand 
on his rifle sling. "On the count 
then,” he said hopelessly. 

Cott reslung his carbine. 
“One,” he said. 

“Two.” He and Chuck picked 
up the count together. 

“Three,” in unison, again. 



IRONCLAD 



93 



“Four.” 

“Fi— ” 

Cott had not bothered to count 
five aloud. The carbine fell into 
his hooked and waiting hands 
and jumped once. Kittredge, in- 
terrupted in the middle of his 
last word, collapsed to the club 
floor. 

Cott looked down at him and 
then back to Michael, who was 
looking at Cott incredulously. 

“Do you stand with him?” 
Cott repeated the formula once 
more. 

Michael shook his head dumb- 
ly- 

“Then turn!” 

Michael nodded. “I’ll turn. 
Sure, I'll be a coward.” There 
was a peculiar quality to his 
voice. Cott had seen men turn 
before, but never as though by 
free choice. Except for Holland, 
of course, the thought came. 

Cott looked at the width of 
Michael’s back, and reslung his 
carbine. “All right, Michael. 
Take your dead home to your 
household.” He stood where he 
was while Chuck’s body was 
hoisted over his brother’s shoul- 
der. “He was a good friend of 
mine, Michael. I’m sorry he 
forced me to do it.” 

As he walked home, past Mr. 
Holland’s house, Cott did not 
turn his head to see if there were 
lights in any of the windows. He 
had kept his Integrity unbreach- 



ed. He had forced another man 
to turn. But he didn’t dare tell 
himself he hoped Barbara would 
understand that, in a sense, he 
had done it for her. 

IV 

rpWO days later, at dinnertime, 
Geoffrey and Alister came in 
five minutes late. Geoffrey’s face 
was wide and numb with shock, 
and Alister’s was glowing with a 
rampant inner joy. It was only 
when Geoffrey turned that Cott 
saw his left sleeve was soaked 
in blood. 

“Geoffrey!” Cott’s mother 
pushed her chair back and ran 
to him. She pulled a med kit off 
its wall bracket and began cut- 
ting the sleeve away. 

“What happened?” Cott asked. 

“I got my man today,” Geof- 
frey said, his voice as numb as 
his features. “He rightfully be- 
longs to Alis, though.” A grin 
broke through the numbness, 
and a babble of words came out 
as the shock of the wound passed 
from numbness to hysteria. 

“That crazy Michael Kittredge 
climbed up a tree at the edge of 
the practice terrain. Had a 
’scope-mounted T-4 and six ex- 
tra clips. Must have figured on 
an all-out war. First thing I 
knew, it felt like somebody hit 
my shoulder with a bat and I was 
down. Slugs plowed the ground 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in circles around me. I tried to 
do something with my rifle, but 
no go. Kittredge must have had 
cross-eyes or something — couldn’t 
hit the side of a cliff with a 
howitzer, after that first shot. 
Damn fool stunt, ’scope-mount- 
ing an automatic — somebody 
should have taught him better — 
and there I was, passing out from 
the recoil every time I squeezed. 
You never saw such a blind 
man’s shooting match in your 
life, Cott! 

“Then, out of this gully that 
he’d been imitating an elephant 
wallowing through, up pops Alis! 
Slaps the old M-l to his scrawny 
little shoulder, stands up like the 
man atop a skeet-shoot trophy 
and starts blasting away at Kit- 
tredge’s tree as if nothing was up 
there but pigeons! Tell you, the 
sight of that came nearer killing 
me than Kittredge’s best out of 
thirty. 

“Well, Kittredge might have 
been crazy, but he wasn’t up to 
ignoring eight 30s. He swings 
that lunatic T-4 of his for Alis, 
here, and this gives me a chance 
to steady up and put a lucky 
shot through a leaf he happened 
to be in back of at the time. He’s 
still out there.” 

Cott felt his teeth go into his 
lower lip. Michael Kittredge! 

“He shot you from ambush?” 

“He wasn’t carrying any ban- 
ners!” 



“But that’s disgraceful!” Cott’s 
mother exclaimed. She finished 
wrapping gauze over the patch 
bandage on Geoffrey’s bicep. 

|^OTT looked at Alister, who 
^ was standing beside Geof- 
frey, his face still shining. “Was 
that what happened, Alister?” he 
asked. 

Alister nodded. 

“Sure, that’s what happened!” 
Geoffrey said indignantly. 
“Think this is a mosquito bite?” 
“You know what this means, 
don’t you?” Cott asked gravely. 

Geoffrey began a shrug and 
winced. “Fool kid with a bug.” 
Cott shook his head. “The Kit- 
tredges may be lax in their train- 
ing, but Michael knew better. In 
a sense, that was a declaration of 
war. .f Michael was out there, 
the rest of his household may not 
have known about it, but they’ll 
be forced to support his action 
when they find out.” 

“So it’s a declaration of war.” 
Alister finally found his voice, 
his tones a conscious imitation 
of Geoffrey’s. “What have we 
been drilling for?” 

Geoffrey’s eyes opened wide, 
and the secretive laughter re- 
turned to his expression as he 
looked at his younger brother. 

“Not to start a war— or get 
involved in one,” Cott said. 
“Their gunnery will be sloppier 
than ours, but I know that their 



IRONCLAD 



95 



armor plate’s just as thick.” 

“.What do you want to do, Cot- 
trell?” his mother asked. Her 
delicate face was anxious, and 
her hands seemed to be poised for 
the express purpose of under- 
scoring the question. 

“We’ve got to stop this thing 
before it snowballs,” Geoffrey 
said. “I didn’t get it before, but 
Cott’s right.” 

Cott nodded. “We’ll have to 
call everybody to a meeting. I 
don't know what can be done 
about the Kittredges. Maybe we’ll 
all be able to think of some- 
thing.” He beat the side of his 
fist lightly against his thigh. “I 
don’t know. It’s never been done 
before. But these aren’t Berendt- 
sen’s Militia. We can’t handle 
the problem by simply dropping 
our shutters and fighting it out 
as independent units. The whole 
community would wind up firing 
on each other. We’ve got to have 
concerted action. Perhaps, if the 
comunity lines up in a solid block 
against the Kittredges, we’ll be 
able to block them.” 

“Unite the community!” His 
mother’s eyes were wide. “Do you 
think you can do it?” 

Cott sighed. “I don’t know, 
Mother. I couldn’t guess.” He 
turned to Alister. “We’re going 
up to the club. It’s the only 
natural meeting place we’ve got. 
I think you’d better break out 
the car. The Kittredges might 



have more snipers out.” 

He picked his carbine from the 
arms-rack and moved to fol- 
low Alister down to the garage. 

“I’ll go with you,” Geoffrey 
said. “Only takes one arm to 
work the turret guns.” 

Cott looked at him indecisive- 
ly. Finally, he said, “All right. 
There’s no telling what the Kit- 
tredges might be up to along 
the road.” He turned back to- 
ward his mother. “I think it 
might be advisable to put the 
household on action stations.” 
She nodded, and he went down 
into the garage. 

rriHE road was open and glar- 
ing white in the sunlight of 
early afternoon. The armored 
car’s tires jounced over the lati- 
tudinal ruts that freight wagons 
had worn into the surface. One 
part of his mind was worried 
about the effect on Geoffrey, bat- 
tened down in the turret. He 
looked up through the overhead 
slits and saw the twin muzzles 
of the 35mm cannon tracking 
steadily counterclockwise. 

When did it begin? he thought. 
The chain of recent events was 
clear. From the moment Mr. 
Holland had discovered him, 
four nights ago. event had fol- 
lowed event as plainly and in- 
evitably as though each had been 
planned. 

If he had not been upset by 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his meeting with Mr. Holland, 
he would not have called Drill 
the following morning. If he had 
never seen Barbara at her win- 
dow at all, there would have 
been nothing for Geoffrey to taunt 
him with and no fear of exposure 
to drive him to the club. If he 
had not been drinking, Mr. Hol- 
land’s references to Uncle James 
would not have cut so deep. Had 
there been no Drill, there would 
have been no quarrel with Chuck 
Kittredge. And even if there had 
been Drill, Chuck’s remarks 
would not have seemed so ob- 
jectionable had there been no 
smoldering resentment from his 
talk with Mr. Holland. 

For he had been angry. Had 
he not been, Chuck and Michael 
would not be dead, and the Gar- 
vins would not now be in the 
car. trying to stop an upheaval 
of violence that would involve 
the entire community. But his 
anger had not been only his re- 
sponsibility. A breach of Integ- 
rity remained a breach of 
Integrity, no matter what the 
subjective state of the Party at 
Grievance. 

But where had it really begun? 
If his mother had introduced him 
to Barbara, would any of this 
have happened? 

He rejected that possibility. 
His mother had been acting in 
accordance with the code that 
his father and the other free 



men who had settled in this area 
had evolved. And the code was 
a good code. It had kept the 
farmlands free and in peace, with 
no man wearing another’s collar 
— until Michael 'Kittredge broke 
the code. 

And, so thinking, he turned the 
car off the road and stopped in 
front of the club. 

TT^HE porch was already crowd- 
ed with men. As he climbed 
out of the car’s hatch, he saw 
that all the families of the com- 
munity, with the exception of 
the Kittredges, were represented. 
Olsen, Hollis, Winter, Jones, Ca- 
dell, Rome, Lynn, Williams, 
Bridges, Van Dali — all of them. 
Even Mr. Holland stood near the 
center of the porch, his lined 
face graver than Cott had ever 
seen it. 

He walked toward them. The 
news had spread rapidly. He re- 
membered that a lot of the 
households had radios now. He 
had never seen any use for them 
before. 

We ought to get one, now, 
though. As long as we're uniting, 
a fast communications channel 
is a good idea. 

“That’s far enough, Garvin!” 
He stopped and stared up at the 
men on the porch. Hollis had 
lifted his rifle. 

Cott frowned. One or two other 
guns in the crowd were being 



IRONCLAD 



97 



raised in his direction. 

“I don’t understand,” he said. 

Hollis snorted. He looked past 
Cott at the car. “Anybody in that 
buggy tries something, we’ve got 
a present for him.” 

The men on the porch drew off 
to either side. Two men were 
crouched in the club’s doorway. 
One held a steady antitank rock- 
et launcher on his shoulder and 
the other, having fed the rocket 
into the chamber, stood ready 
to slap the top of his head for 
the signal to fire. 

“I’m afraid I don’t — ” 

“Looks like you’ve united the 
community, boy,” Mr. Holland 
said. “Against you.” 

Cott felt the familiar surge of 
anger ripple through his body. 
“ Against me! What for?” 

There was a scattered chorus 
of harsh laughs. 

“What about Chuck Kit- 
tredge?” Hollis asked. 

“ Chuck Kittredge! That was 
an affair of Integrity,” Cott ex- 
ploded. 

“Yeah? Whose — yours or his?” 
Hollis said. 

“Seems like the day of In- 
tegrity has come and gone, son,” 
Mr. Holland said gently. 

“Yeah, and what about Mich- 
ael Kittredge?” somebody shout- 
ed from the back of the crowd. 
“Was that an affair of Integrity 
too?” 

“What about those two broth- 



ers of yours shooting him out of 
that tree?” someone else demand- 
ed. 

“Geoffrey’s in the car with a 
wounded arm right now!” Cott 
yelled. 

“And Michael Kittredge is 
dead!” 

There was a babble of voices. 
The burst of sound struck Cott’s 
ears. “All right!” he shouted. “ All 
right! I came up here to ask you 
to stop the Kittredges with me. I 
see they got to you first. All 
right! Then we’ll take them on 
alone, and the devil can have all 
of you!” 

COMEHOW, in the storm of an- 
^ swers that came from the 
porch, Mr. Holland’s quiet voice 
came through. 

“No good, boy. When I said 
‘against you,’ I meant it. It’s not 
a case of them not helping you — 
it means they’re going to start 
shelling your place in two hours, 
whether you’re in it or not.” 

“No!” The word was torn out 
of him, and even he had to ana- 
lyze its expression. It was not a 
command nor a request nor a 
statement of fact or wonder. It 
was simply a word and he knew 
better than anyone else who 
heard it how ineffectual it was. 

“So you’d better get your fam- 
ily out of there, son.” The other 
men on the porch had fallen 
silent, all of them watching ex- 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cept for the two men with the 
rocket launcher, who ignored 
everything but the armored car. 

Mr. Holland came off the porch 
and walked toward him. He put 
his hand on his shoulder. “Let’s 
be getting back, son. Lots of room 
at my place for your family.” 
Cott looked up at the men on 
the porch again. They were com- 
pletely silent, all staring back at 
him as though he were some 
strange form of man they had 
never seen before. 

He muttered, “All right.” 

Mr. Holland climbed through 
the hatch, and Cott followed him, 
slamming it shut and settling into 



the driver’s seat. He gunned the 
idling engine, locked his left rear 
wheel, spun the car around. With 
the motor at full gun and the 
dust billowing behind it, the 
armored car roared back down 
the road. 

“I heard most of it, Cott.” 
Geoffrey’s tight and bitter voice 
came over the intercom. “Let’s 
get back to the house in a hurry. 
We can dump a ton of frag on 
that porch before those birds find 
out what’s hitting them.” 

Cott shook his head before 
he remembered that Geoffrey 
couldn’t see him. “They’ll be 
gone, Jeff. Scattered to their 




RONCLAD 



99 




houses, getting ready.” 

“Well, let’s hit their houses, 
then,” Alister said from behind 
the machine gun at the car’s 
turtledeck. 

“Wouldn’t stand a chance, 
son,” Mr. Holland said. 

“He’s right.. They’ve got us 
cold,” Cott agreed. 

What had happened to the 
code? His father had lived by 
it — all the people in the com- 
munity had lived by it. He him- 
self had lived by it — he caught 
himself. Had tried to live by it, 
and failed. 

V 

C OTT stood in the yard in 
front of Mr. Holland’s house. 
It had taken an hour and a half 
of the time Hollis had given him 
to get back to his house and move 



his family and a few belongings 
into Mr. Holland’s house. He had 
kissed his mother and raised his 
hand as she turned back at the 
doorway. “I’ll be all right, Moth- 
er,” he said. “There are a few 
things that I’d like to attend to.” 
“All right, son. Don’t be long.” 
He nodded, though she was al- 
ready inside the house. 

Geoffrey and Alister were deep 
inside Mr. Holland’s house, tak- 
ing care of their grandmother and 
the younger children. Cott smiled 
crookedly. Alister would be all 
right. He hoped Geoffrey wasn’t 
too old to adapt. 

Mr.' Holland came out. “Com- 
ing in, son?” He chuckled. “I’ll 
introduce you to my daughter.” 
Barbara. He looked at the Sun. 
No, not enough time. Well, 
there’d be plenty afterward. 

“I’ll be back, Mr. Holland. Got 
a few loose ends to tie up.” 
Holland looked over the low, 
barely visible roof of Cott’s 
house. 

A small dustcloud was ap- 
proaching it from the other side. 
He nodded. “Yeah, I see what 
you mean. Well, hurry up. You 
haven’t got more than about 
twenty minutes.” 

Cott nodded. “I’ll see you.” He 
dropped the carbine into his hand 
and loped out of the yard, not 
having to worry about the dog 
now, cutting through the low un- 
derbrush until he was just below 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



100 



the crest of a rise that overlooked 
his house. He flattened himself in 
the high grass and inched for- 
ward, until his head and shoul- 
ders were over the crest, but still 
hidden in the grass. 

He had been right. There were 
three men just climbing out of a 
light guncarrier. 

Looters, he thought. Well, 
that's what our grandparents 
were. He slipped the safety. And 
our parents had a code. And now, 
his brothers had a united com- 
munity. But I’ve lived in the past 
all my life, and I guess I’ve got 
Integrity. 

He fired, and one of the men 
slapped at his stomach and fell. 

'T'HE other two dived apart, 
their own rifles in their hands. 
Cott laughed and threw dirt into 
their faces with a pair of shots. 
One of them bucked his shoul- 
ders up involuntarily as the dirt 
flew into his eyes. Cott fired 
again, and the shoulders slump- 
ed. Thanks for a trick, Geoffrey. 

The other man fired back — 
using half a clip to cut the grass 
a foot to Cott’s right. He drop- 
ped back below the crest, rolled 
and came up again, ten feet from 
where he had been. 

Down by the house, the re- 
maining man moved. Cott put a 
bullet an inch above his head. 

He had about ten minutes. 
Well, if he kept that man pinned 



down, the first salvo would do 
as thorough a job as any carbine 
shot. 

The man moved again — a little 
desperately this time — and Cott 
tugged at his pants leg with a 
snap shot. 

Five minutes, and the man 
moved again. He was shouting 
something. Cott turned his ear 
toward him to cut the hum from 
the breeze, but couldn’t make out 
the words. He pinned the man 
down again. 

When he had a minute of life 
left, the man tried to run for it. 
He sprang up suddenly, running 
away from the guncarrier, and 
Cott missed him for that reason. 
When the man cut back, he shot 
him through the leg. 

Damn! Jeff could have done 
better than that! 

The man was crawling for the 
carrier. 

Over at the Kittredge’s, the 
first muzzle-flashes flared, and 
the thud of the guns rolled over 
the hills. 

Cott put a bullet through the 
crawling man’s head. 

He had been right about the 
Kittredges’ poor gunnery, as he 
had been about the looters. The 
first salvo landed a hundred 
yards over — on the very crest of 
the ridge where Cott was stand- 
ing, his carbine in his hand. Poor 
shooting, but just as fatal.

Of 

Venus 

A pioneer movement is like 
a building — the foundation 
is never built for beauty! 



By A. H. PHELPS, Jr. 



T HE telephone rang. Reluc- 
tantly, Rod Workham 
picked it up. Nothing good 
had come from that phone in six 
years, and his sour expression 
was almost an automatic reflex. 
“Workham here,” he said. 

He held the phone an inch 
away from his ear, but the tirade 
exceeded his expectations — it 
would have been audible a foot 
away: 

“Workham! How long do you 
think we’re going to stand for 
this! At the rate you’re going, 
there won’t be a man left on 



Venus or a dollar in the budget! 
What kind of a personnel director 
are you? Don’t you know this 
project is vital to every person 
on Earth? Thirty more resigna- 
tions came in on this last mail 
flight.” 

Rod put the receiver gently on 
his desk. General Carlson raved 
and ranted this way every time 
a colonist quit, and Rod knew he 
was not expected to answer, even 
if given the chance. The general 
would carry on for about five 
minutes and then would slam 
down the phone himself. 



Illustrated by FREAS 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He dialed another number on 
the other phone. 

“This is Rod, Dave,” he said 
when he got an answer. “Carlson 
is on the other phone, yelling at 
my desk blotter. He says thirty 
more resignations came in just 
now. That right?” 

“Close enough, Rod — twenty- 
three pulled out. That makes 
seventy-eight per cent resigned 
in less than — ” 

"Spare me the statistics — Carl- 
son’s probably blatting them right 
now. How do they break down? 
Are they mostly farmers or tech- 
nicians?” 

“There were only nine tech- 
nicians left, and all of them quit 
with this bunch. The rest were 
farmers.” Dave Newson must be 
smoking his pipe, Rod decided — 
grinding sounds were coming over 
the phone. “That doesn’t leave 
very much on Venus to start a 
colony with — a few farmers, some 
trappers. And the scientific per- 
sonnel — damn it, they seem to 
stick it out all right — ” 

“Their contracts are different,” 
Rod reminded him. “They go on 
a two year hitch and then come 
back to Earth if they want to. 
The ones who are there are the 
ones who can take it and are 
signed up again.” 

HHHERE was a speculative 
pause on the other end of the 
line. “Say, Rod," Newson said 



slowly. “Why not leave this last 
batch of quitters right where they 
are? Every one of them. They 
signed up for the project with 
their eyes open. Why don’t you 
just refuse to bring them home? 
. they’d have to make a go 
of the colony to save their filthy 
necks!” 

Rod grinned nastily. “I’d like 
to do it — but even General Carl- 
son wouldn’t dare. We’d never 
get another colonist off Earth, 
once it got out. They wouldn’t 
trust us. Our first problem is to 
get a self-supporting society on 
Venus — and that might do it, all 
right. But our main job is to re- 
lieve the crowding on Earth, and 
that means large numbers of peo- 
ple will have to go willingly later 
on. If we get tough with these 
babies, who will take a chance 
later on that we won’t repeat 
the trick?” 

“But we lose a hundred poten- 
tial colonists every time one of 
these quitters starts talking about 
why he left! More harm is done 
by letting them come back than 
would result from leaving them 
where they are.” Again the specu- 
lative pause. "Maybe you could 
shoot them on arrival?” 

“I’ll suggest it to the general 
when I see him,” Rod said, “if 
he doesn’t shoot me first. Now, 
can you get me the files on this 
latest group? And I’d like to see 
the staff psychologist here, along 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



103 



with all the interviewers who 
handled and passed the group. 
We’ll see what we can salvage 
out of this. And if you see 
Jaimie, send him along too, will 
you? Maybe our gambling his- 
torian can find us something use- 
ful in the Project Record.” 

“The files are already on the 
way. And I told Biddington you’d 
probably want to see him — he 
said he’d be along in about ten 
minutes. I haven’t located all the 
interviewers yet. Jaimie’s been 
right here, trying to talk me into 
a game of Nim and protesting 
he never heard of binary num- 
bers. I’ll send him up, but keep 
your hand on your wallet. If you 
need anything else, I’ll be right 
here.” 

T>OD thanked him and hung 
up, shaking his head. Dave 
Newsom was too good a man to 
be stuck on a government project 
— he ought to get out before the 
trouble started. Anyone who 
worked for Rod Workham on 
Project Venus was likely to end 
up with a bad name. They lived 
under the ax. The only person 
who could be sure of his job was 
Rod himself. He’d been recom- 
mended by a committee of top 
men in his field, and no other 
personnel man would accept the 
job if he were removed. Also, 
most of his men would leave 
the project if General Carlson 



bounced him, for they had been 
telling him so ever since the job 
had gotten hot. 

But there was the danger that 
the general might decide to by- 
pass Personnel in selecting colon- 
ists — or, what was more prob- 
able, might try to tame the planet 
with a military outpost. 

Rod could hardly blame the 
man for his feelings. The job wa- 
vital, and everyone was intensely 
interested in making a go of it. 
Scientific agriculture had gone 
about as far as it could; hydro- 
ponics had already begun to 
shoulder the load required by an 
overpopulated planet. But the 
fact known to most intelligent 
people on Earth was that either 
new room was found in this kind 
of emergency, some place where 
people could go and live under 
nearly the same standards, or 
else some drastic changes in liv- 
ing standards would be required 
of all. And absolute and rigidly 
enforced birth control would have 
to go into effect. And all the 
attendant causes for race wars, 
nationalist wars, and have-not 
wars would crop up. 

But the majority of the people 
wouldn’t move to an undeveloped 
planet. You couldn’t send or- 
dinary citizens as pioneers. For 
one thing, they wouldn’t want to 
go. For another, the new com- 
munity wouldn’t last long if you 
forced them to go — the average

person had neither the attitudes 
nor the physique needed to make 
over a wilderness. 

The problem was to find people 
who would create a community 
on a new planet and develop an 
integrated society there. This had 
meant rigid selection, careful 
psychological preparation and a 
terrifically expensive transporta- 
tion system to get the people 
there and keep them supplied. 
And the job had to be done soon. 
Economists predicted that thirty 
years were left on Earth under 
present standards, maybe fifty. 
If the population couldn’t be 
thinned out one way by then, 
it would have to be done by an- 
other. 

17'OR six years, now, Rod had 
worked on the job of estab- 
lishing a self-supporting colony 
on Venus. Three different colon- 
ies had been started, and each 
had died out in less than two 
years. Resignations would come 
in slowly at first, and then in a 
rush, until only twenty or thirty 
people would be left, of which the 
majority would be short-term 
scientific teams. By the terms of 
the colonists’ contracts no man 
could be left on Venus more than 
a month after his resignation; so 
the bulk of two colonies had 
simply had to be shipped back 
to Earth, and plans made for 
another try. 



And now the third colony was 
quitting, rushing home, leaving 
nothing on the jungle planet but 
a few small clearings soon to be 
taken over by the vegetation. 

Several times in the last year 
Rod had thought of volunteer- 
ing himself; but he knew it for a 
futile gesture. He wasn’t five hun- 
dred men. He didn’t even have 
the special skills or physique that 
were needed. 

His gloomy thoughts were in- 
terrupted by the arrival of the 
men. 

Biddington was first. Then in 
twos and threes came the inter- 
viewers, all looking like the home 
team at the half, three touch- 
downs behind and just waiting 
for their coach. 

If psychologists made good 
colonists, Rod thought, here 
would be a dozen more volun- 
teers. 

The arrival of Homer Jaimison 
brought the only cheerful face 
in the group. The project his- 
torian was a young man, just 
over thirty, and considerably over 
six feet. He wore the expression 
of a man who is itching to do 
something. Jaimie had never 
really been busy yet on the 
project — the colonies had died out 
so quickly that his work had 
been mostly clerical, and he’d 
had to fill in time as best he 
could. So far he had done it 
making up improbable contests 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

of skill for drinks, with such a 
weird assortment of shifting rules 
and scoring that he hadn’t paid 
for a drink since his arrival. 
He made a valuable contribution 
to the project, however, since 
he helped to keep the group’s 
minds off their troubles a part 
of the time. 

Rod genuinely liked Jaimie, 
and expected to miss him strong- 
ly when Venus became self-sup- 
porting to the point where the 
historian would have to complete 
his work in residence. 

TV7HEN they were all seated, 
** Rod leaned against his desk 
and said, “I can see you all 
know why we’re here. To begin 
with, I’m not going to accuse 
anyone of mistakes. Each of you 
is the best possible man in the 
country* for his job. If you 
weren’t, you wouldn’t be here. I 
wouldn’t have asked for you; 
and General Carlson wouldn’t 
have kept you. So there’s nothing 
to feel bad about. If you can’t 
do this work, no one can. Self- 
recrimination is foolish when 
you’ve been put on an impos- 
sible problem. I didn’t call you 
in to bawl you out, but to ask 
you if we should continue spend- 
ing project funds for nothing.” 

Jaimie raised his eyebrows at 
this speech, but said nothing. 

“What do you mean, impos- 
sible problem?” one of the inter- 



viewers objected. “We know what 
we need — it’s just that we’re still 
making some mistake in selection 
that we haven’t corrected.” 

“That’s right, Rod.” Bidding- 
ton, the project psychologist, took 
up the dissension. “We know 
something is wrong with the se- 
lection techniques, or in the per- 
sonality patterns we consider 
necessary. But it’s only a prob- 
lem of finding out what it is. The 
problem is by no means insolu- 
ble.” 

“As long as you’re not ready 
to give us up,” another inter- 
viewer said, “we aren’t going to 
quit.” 

“You can’t afford to get defeat- 
ist about this, Rod,” Biddington 
went on. “This project is too 
important to fail. Whether you 
like it or not, your experience is 
too valuable for you to back out.” 

Rod grinned and held up his 
hands. “All right. That’s the re- 
action I wanted. If you all still 
think we can get somewhere, we 
may as well try to analyze this 
last group.” He sat down at his 
desk. “I have the files here, along 
with the tapes of the interviews. 
Let’s see what difference we can 
find between those who hung on 
this long, and the ones that quit 
after the first three months.” 

npHE group settled down to try- 
-*• ing to differentiate between 
a man who couldn’t do a job 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but could try for six months 
longer than the next. They took 
the colonists carefully apart, trait 
by trait, and put them all back. 
They reviewed the colonists’ rec- 
ords from birth, and compared 
them in endless combinations. 
Jaimie came into the discussion 
to show what the status of the 
colonies had been at the time 
each colonist had resigned: what 
diseases had been encountered 
when one man quit; how much 
jungle had been cleared before 
another did. 

Files came and went in a con- 
tinuous flux; coffee and sand- 
wiches came and grew cold and 
stale. The air became gray with 
smoke. 

Nothing. 

The same results had come out 
of every investigation: You need- 
ed a man who was unstable to 
get him to leave Earth. You need- 
ed a man who was stable to have 
him stay on Venus. You needed 
initiative and resourcefulness to 
survive on a new planet. You 
needed a man who had so little 
initiative and resourcefulness that 
the competition on Earth wouldn’t 
be profitable,. You needed a 
young, healthy, vigorous speci- 
men. You needed an older, ex- 
perienced, more mature person. 

You needed A and you needed 
non-A. 

And even if you found people 
with the factors balanced just 



right, assuming you knew what 
the balance should be, where did 
you find five hundred of them? 

The discussion went on. The 
solutions got wilder and more 
absurd. Take whole orphan asy- 
lums and bring them up on Venus 
under military guard. Build a 
development in the . steamiest, 
nastiest jungle, and test recruits 
for the colony there. Send African 
natives. 

The men were beginning to 
make the whole thing look im- 
possible again, so Rod decided to 
call a halt until they could get a 
better perspective. Tired himself, 
he dismissed them. They left 
quietly, not arguing in little 
groups or mumbling half-formed 
ideas to themselves, the way a 
team that has been progressing 
will do. 

/~\NLY Jaimie stayed. He re- 
mained sitting hunched up 
near the desk, in the same posi- 
tion he’d held for the last hour. 
When the others had all left, 
he grinned at Rod. 

“You know, for a group of 
practicing psychologists, this is 
the softest bunch of suckers I’ve 
seen.” 

“You’ve proved that to your 
own profit several times so far,” 
Rod answered, rubbing his face 
as though smoothing the wrinkles 
could remove the tension. “Who 
have you robbed lately?” 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



107 



"I’m talking about your per- 
formance just now. Here comes 
the whole crew, walking in with 
their heads hanging to the floor. 
Every last man was ready to tell 
you he was quitting — that the 
problem was insoluble. And be- 
fore anyone can say a word, 
you tell them that the whole 
thing is impossible and imply 
that you want to quit. Even Bid- 
dington fell for it. You can’t back 
out now, Rod, they say. Let’s 
not have defeatist talk out of 
you, of all people — ” 

“I did feel that way,” Rod 
said. “I’m just about ready to 
quit. I think that whatever our 
mistake has been, we can’t do 
any better than we have. We 
just don’t know enough.” 

Jaimie wasn’t grinning now. 
“What will happen if you quit?” 
“My guess is that Carlson will 
set up a military outpost there. 
Make a clearing, build a fort, 
maybe a town. Then he’ll try 
to get people to come and live 
in it.” Rod sighed. “It won’t 
work. They’ll want to know why 
the planet had to be colonized 
that way — why wouldn’t the first 
colonists stay?” 

“I agree. The military outpost 
is a fine method for spreading 
a culture to an existing civiliza- 
tion. Rome did much for Europe 
that way; the most powerful cities 
sprang up near the Roman forts 
and roads. But as a method for 



inducing the populace to a new 
place, it doesn’t work. A free 
people will not willingly move 
into a military township.” Jaimie 
looked sharply at Rod. “So what 
do you intend to do — run out 
and turn it all over to Carlson?” 

“I don’t know, Jaimie. I just 
don’t know. Six years is a long 
time.” 

“Damn it, Rod, you had much 
worse jobs than this one in in- 
dustry! How did you select a 
computer man, a communica- 
tions man, an engineering physi- 
cist, out of a group of men with 
similar backgrounds? It seems to 
me a harder problem than this.” 

“We don’t really know much, 
as I said,” Rod said. “Ours has 
often been an imitation science. 
When we had to select a com- 
puter man, we just gave a bat- 
tery of tests to successful com- 
puter men — structural vision, 
vocabulary, tri -dimensional mem- 
ory, ink-blots, syllogisms, prac- 
tically everything. Then we 
weeded out the tests whose scores 
appeared to have no statistical 
relevance. Any future computer 
man had to duplicate those re- 
sults, whatever they were. If we 
had a recently pioneered civiliza- 
tion around, Jaimie, you’d find 
this whole staff running through 
it like pollsters before an elec- 
tion.” 

“What was all this talk about 
balance, instability, initiative and 



10B 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



all the rest?” asked Jamie. 

‘‘That’s what we do when we 
don’t know, Jaimie. We try to 
predict what we need; then we 
try to find ways of finding it in 
people.” 

J AIMIE made an explosive 
sound. ‘‘But I thought you 
must have progressed from em- 
pirical methods! I would have 
said something long ago, if I 
hadn’t thought you knew what 
you were doing all the time!” 
The historian was on his feet, 
stalking about the room. “Why 
didn’t you tell me about this be- 
fore?” 

“Why? What difference would 
it have made?” Rod frowned, 
failing to understand the other’s 
excitement. “Sure, we’ve prog- 
ressed from the older methods, in 
that we now have pretty com- 
plete data for all present job de- 
scriptions. And we can synthesize 
data for a new job, if it’s not too 
different. But there isn’t any in- 
formation on the kind of person 
needed in a new world. What the 
devil are you getting so upset 
about?” 

The historian threw himself 
into a chair and glared at Rod. 
“If you couldn’t find the kind 
of people you needed to test, you 
could have asked a historian if 
he knew anything about them!” 
Rod shook his head puzzledly. 
“Subjective data, such as that — ” 



“Don’t bring subjectivity into 
this, damn it! We get enough of 
that from physical scientists.” 
Jaimie held himself in the chair, 
almost shaking with the intensity 
of his feeling. “Look, Rod, you 
know I want to see the project 
succeed. And you admit that you 
haven’t got an answer. Well, 
baby, I think I have! It’s an 
idea that has about a fifty-fifty 
chance of being right in this case 
. would you be willing to try 
it?” 

“If I had been betting on your 
side for the last few months, I’d 
be several dollars richer,” Rod 
smiled. “Yes, I think I might go 
along with your idea, if you can 
convince me it has an even chance 
for success. Three failures out of 
three tries makes for poorer odds 
than that. What do you have in 
mind?” 

“H’m,” Jaimie said. “I imagine 
your stock isn’t so high with old 
scabbard and blade right now, 
is it?” 

Rod laughed. “I don’t think 
he’ll shoot on sight, but I’m 
not positive enough to stand in 
front of a lighted window.” 

“Well, then — if I had an idea 
you agreed with, the surest way 
to kill it would be to have you 
present it to him, right? And if 
you fight it, that’s sure to con- 
vince Carlson!” Jaimie thought 
hard for a moment, tapping the 
chair-arm. “Rod, I have to do 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



109 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



something you aren’t going to 
like. Do you trust me?” 

“You mean you’re going to try 
this without even discussing it 
with the personnel group?” 

“That’s right. If I don’t tell 
you what I’m doing, I know 
you’ll fight it. And I’ll need that 
kind of help from you to push 
Carlson into doing it. 

“But I have to do something 
far worse than that, Rod. I’m 
going to tell the general that you 
knew my plan from the start, and 
have been sitting on it because 
I’m not a psychologist. I’m going 
to ruin your reputation with the 
worst set of lies since the Red 
purges. I’ll say you’re fighting 
me, because you can’t accept an 
idea that came from a man out- 
side of your own group. If the 
scheme doesn’t work you’ll be 
ruined, because there’ll be no way 
to retract the lies. If it does 
work, we can announce that we 
put on an act to sell the plan to 
Carlson. Can you take it?” 

Rod was thoughtful for a few 
minutes. He liked and trusted 
Jaimie, but the man had no ex- 
perience in this field — and this 
sounded like an all-or-nothing 
shot. 

Then he remembered his de- 
spair over the latest set of resig- 
nations. He’d been ready to quit 
— he had nothing to offer, and 
neither did his men. Even a wild 
idea was worth a try, he thought 



grimly — he would be risking 
nothing but a plan that had al- 
ready failed. 

“Go to it, boy,” he said. “And 
if you need a fight, you’ll get a 
damn good one.” 

*TDHE fight with Carlson was 
short, and Rod was abruptly 
overruled. After that Jaimie 
moved fast. The new colonists 
flocked in. Three months after 
Rod’s talk with him, the com- 
pounds started to fill. A shipload 
was a hundred men, and each 
new man had to wait in a group 
until it was filled. But there was 
no waiting now except for pro- 
cessing; the compounds were full 
before the ships were ready. 

Rod had paid no attention 
to Jaimie’s recruiting methods, 
thinking that the historian’s idea 
differed mainly in control over 
the colonists. 

Until he saw the crowds. 

Even from a distance, they/ 
didn’t have the young look of 
the previous groups. Up close, 
they looked like the sweepings of 
the slums. 

He and Biddington talked to a 
few before they fully realized 
what Jaimie had done. All the 
men were sure that Venus was a 
mineral paradise — gold in the 
streams, uranium lodes so pure 
you had to wear a shield to get 
near them, diamonds, silver — 
every treasure that had ever ex- 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



111 



cited men on Earth was scat- 
tered around the new world wait- 
ing to be picked up. That was 
what Jaimie had told them. 

Rod got to a phone, fast. 

“Jaimie, you fool! I know what 
you’re doing, and I won’t put up 
with it! You’ve told these dupes 
they can get rich on Venus! You 
intended to attract large num- 
bers of recruits, in the hope that 
some of them will be what we 
need — but look at what you at- 
tracted! Crooks, gangsters, bums, 
hoboes, sharecroppers and I don’t 
know what. You got recruits all 
right . but what the hell kind 
of a society are you going to start 
with them! And who will go and 
live there among them later?” 

“What’s the matter, Work- 
ham?” Jaimie asked coldly. “Are 
you a racial purist? Want only 
your kind of people to get to 
Venus?” 

“I don’t care who goes, as long 
as they fit some standards. But 
to make a decent place, you need 
decent people — morally clean and 
healthy. Not this collection of 
mental cripples, alcoholics and 
thieves. Probably half of them 
are wanted men!” 

He argued further, unable to 
believe that this was Jaimison’s 
great fifty-fifty chance. He said 
many things . and regretted 
every one ; for that night the 
telecasts carried a recorded ver- 
sion of his outburst. Jaimie had 



maneuvered him into saying 
things he didn’t quite mean, so 
that it looked as if he was trying 
to hide the all good things on 
Venus and save them for his own 
friends. One commentator said 
outright that if you weren’t a 
college graduate recommended by 
one of Workham’s friends, it 
would cost you a thousand dol- 
lars to get on an outgoing ship. 
By the next morning, half the 
papers in the world were after 
Workham’s scalp. 

R OD could only take the abuse 
and grind his teeth. How did 
you fight a thing like that? You 
were condemned if you kept 
silent, and if you answered, peo- 
ple nodded their heads and said, 
“See — he’s still trying to deny it.” 
The failures from the old col- 
onies were Rod’s only allies. They 
tried to tell people what Venus 
was like, and what lies Carlson 
and his stooge Jaimison were 
using for bait. But it was pointed 
out that these men naturally had 
a stake in the secret . and, after 
all, everyone knew how well off 
the returning colonists were! This 
was actually due to the high 
premium paid to get men to go 
to the planet, but no one be- 
lieved. 

Days passed. Weeks. The com- 
pounds filled, and emptied, and 
filled again. People stood in lines 
to apply. They walked miles to

appear at a recruiting center. 
They fought for a place on the 
next ship, or the one after that. 
Farmers, clerks, ragged families, 
hoboes, armed men, teen-age 
boys and old men. Four thousand 
people applied in the first few 
months and were shipped out. 
Then the crowds thinned, even 
though the Get Rich propaganda 
continued. Soon, only a few hun- 
dred appeared where there had 
been thousands; then twos and 
threes; at last only a dozen or 
so a day, many of whom changed 
their minds before the full ship- 
load had been assembled. 

Rod clung to his job through- 
out. He had little to do, though 
his department had never been 
formally discontinued. Sooner or 
later, he knew, their services 
would be needed — when this 
cheap trick had failed. So he 
and his staff remained. Studying 
old files, making up test batteries, 
discussing survival factors, they 
readied themselves for the project 
again. From time to time they 
interviewed and tested a few of 
those waiting in the compounds. 
There was too much time to just 
sit around — even this activity was 
a welcome diversion. 

As the year passed, the number 
of prospective colonists stopped 
decreasing and held steady at 
about five a day. But slowly 
something else changed. Among 
the new arrivals there began to 



appear engineers who had tossed 
up good jobs to emigrate, farm- 
ers with their families, school- 
teachers, storekeepers, lawyers, 
even doctors. All of them young. 
Not in any great number; but 
their appearance was a surprise 
still. Then there came two former 
colonists who had resigned on 
one of the earlier attempts, now 
trying to get back to Venus with- 
out inducement of bonus, high 
pay or guaranteed return. 

That was the day Rod decided 
to call on Jaimie. 

“T HAVE here a bottle of eight- 
year-old rye, Jaimie,” he 
began. “I think you’re entitled 
to a drink, and I’m entitled to an 
explanation. Want to swap?” 

“Rod!” Jaimie’s bony face lit 
up. “It’s good to see you. I’ve 
been afraid to call you until we 
could admit to the hoax. Come 
in, come in.” 

“Well, you did it,” Rod said, 
after they had settled down. “I 
met two former colonists in the 
compound today. They know 
there isn’t gold on Venus, and 
still they want to go out for free. 
No contract. And lately we’ve 
been getting professional people. 
There was even a kid fresh out 
of journalism school who wants 
to start up a paper. Jaimie, how 
did you do it? Were we so far 
wrong as that?” 

“You did it yourself, Rod. You 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



113 



told me how — but you wouldn’t 
have believed, then. Or if you 
had, we never would have sold it 
to Carlson. Remember, you said 
if there were only a recent pio- 
neer civilization around, you’d 
run to them with ink-blots and 
vocabulary tests? All you need- 
ed to do was duplicate the kind 
of person who settled America 
or Australia or California. 

“Well, as a historian I knew 
those people. And I knew what 
brought them. So I merely put 
out the same kind of bait.” 

“The same kind of bait!” Rod 
exclaimed. “What about freedom 
of religion and freedom from op- 
pression? Isn’t that what brought 
people to this country? There’s 
no oppression to flee from these 
days! And even if it was the same 
bait, why weren’t the same kind 
of people attracted? You saw 
that first compound full — where 
in that cesspool was Thomas 
Paine, or Franklin, or Miles 
Standish?” 

“Franklin was born here,” 
Jaimie grinned. “Paine didn’t 
come over in the first wave. And 
I suppose General Carlson was 
Miles Standish. Maybe that kid 
journalist you saw was Paine’s 
counterpart. No, Rod — the bait I 
held out attracted the same kind 
of people initially as it always 
has. You have been compromis- 
ing all along on the factors you 
really wanted in order to get 



young, healthy, moral people to 
Venus. The answer is simply this: 
Pioneers are not necessarily 
young, healthy, or moral. So you 
didn’t get what you wanted. 

“You see, America wasn’t only 
founded by pilgrims. They were 
actually a minority here. We were 
settled by promoters, trappers, 
bonded servants, exiled Brit- 
ish deportees, pickpockets and 
thieves. We were explored by 
French and Spanish pirates. The 
better element in Europe didn’t 
come here at first — why should 
they? It was dangerous. Pioneer- 
ing was to the advantage of the 
worst elements. They came by 
court order, out of necessity, for 
adventure. They came for gold 
more than for freedom; for a new 
chance more than for a new re- 
ligion. 

“Australia was set up as a 
penal colony. Others went there 
for gold, or to start over where 
they weren’t known. That’s the 
kind of person who settles a new 
land — the misfits: too impulsive, 
drunkards, weaklings, convicts, 
and fugitives from justice. Too 
sick in mind and body to make 
a go of it where they are. 

“So we announced that there 
was a brand new world with a 
new chance for everyone on it. 
We implied that there was 
wealth. We told them everything 
about Venus that brought the 
English to America, the Spanish 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to South America, the Easterners 
to the West, and the Middlewest- 
erners to California. We didn’t 
hunt for pioneers. They came to 
us.” 

R OD refilled his glass thought- 
fully. ‘‘But what kind of a 
society will men like that create? 
A fighting, lawless structure . .” 
“That's right. And the lawless 
will eliminate themselves by their 
very activities. Like the early 
West. While, the doctors come in 
to treat wounds, and the lawyers 
to plead their cases; while their 
wives and the other wives will 
start schools and bring in school- 
teachers. That society will purge 
itself, Rod — many of the worst 
will become good citizens out of 
meeting the challenge of a new 
planet, and the rest will disap- 
pear.” 

“Well, then, what about the 
gold story?” Rod asked. “Won’t 
they be angry with everyone con- 
nected with the project because 
of the hoax?” 

“That was a little raw, but no 
worse than other gold rushes — 
few of the stampeders ever found 
the gold they went after. The 
captain of one of the rockets told 
me that the first few months the 
colonists were trying to stow 
away on the returning ships. Now 
they send messages to friends and 



relatives to come before the op- 
portunity is gone — that’s why 
you’ve seen this better element. 
Our lies will soon be forgotten, 
and crops and foods and min- 
erals will be coming from Venus, 
and better people will go to meet 
the diminished challenge on our 
brave new world.” 

Rod stood up. “Well, my com- 
pliments for a job well done, 
Jaimie. When do you expect to 
go and live there yourself? You’ll 
have to soon, won’t you, to com-

idence?” 

Jaimie nodded. “About six 
months from now, I think. 
Why?” 

“Good,” Rod exclaimed. “We 
can all go together.” 

“What are you planning to do? 
Volunteer?” 

“The whole personnel staff will 
be going. Here’s just what we 
need — a young pioneer society! 
We can get adequate data for 
future selection, a better idea of 
what kind of person a colony 
needs at different stages of 
growth.” Rod grinned. “After all, 
your method was pretty sloppy, 
even if it did work. And you sent 
far too many wrong people. 
Once we have some good data 
. anything you can do, we can 
do better!”

THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



115 




ONE by David Karp. Vanguard 
Press, New York, 1953. 311 pages, 
$3.50 

/CONCERN about the nature of 
^ the World of Tomorrow is a 
recurrent theme in science fiction. 
Last month we had Bradbury’s 
Fahrenheit 451; this month coiiie 
Kornbluth’s satirically odd Syn- 
dic, reviewed below, and Karp’s 
shocking novel about a civiliza- 
tion in which independent think- 
ing is heresy, punishable by death 
if the person cannot be “cured” 
by the vicious methods of pharm- 
aceutical psychiatry. 



You may not enjoy reading 
Karp’s first novel — it is hardly 
time-passing entertainment — but 
you certainly will find it gripping 
and unforgettable. 

It concerns Professor Burden, 
a benevolent spy in his college, 
who reports to the State on what 
he considers to be his colleagues’ 
“heresies,” or errors of free think- 
ing. Burden is called in by the 
State’s thought control agency 
and is himself found to be suffer- 
ing from the mortal heresy of in- 
dividualism and belief in his 
intellectual superiority. He is in- 
carcerated and put through one

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of the most horrid courses of de- 
personalization I have ever read 
about. His individuality is literal- 
ly destroyed and a new person- 
ality — slavishly acquiescent — is 
built up. The end, however, in- 
dicates that the job of eliminat- 
ing independence and obtaining 
conformity is not as easy as the 
State leaders hope it is. 

The book is written in a style 
simple enough to permit both 
people and ideas to shine through 
in all their luridness, yet individ- 
ual enough to shine through by 
themselves.

THE SYNDIC by C. M. Korn- 
bluth. Doubleday and Co., New 
York, 1953. 223 pages, $2.95 

W HERE One is a study of 
psycho-sociological horror, 
Kornbluth’s is rip-roaring melo- 
drama of the future. Yet under- 
lying it, too, is a bitter analysis 
of some of the trends in modern 
society, more fantastic than in 
Karp’s book, but not much less 
ominous. 

Kornbluth conceives of a so- 
ciety in which government, with 
its increasing tendency to con- 
formity, militarism and bureau- 
cracy, has been driven from the 
United States by two sets of 
gangsters. In the West, centered 



on Chicago, is Mob territory, 
with a civilization based on the 
violence of gang war. In the East, 
the Syndic has evolved a way of 
life in which the customs of the 
gambler, the horse parlor opera- 
tor, the easy-virtue girl, the 
Tammany-type politician have 
become the accepted mores. It is 
a time when, as the jacket blurb 
puts it, “people never had it so 
good,” (in Syndic territory, at 
least) . 

The plot concerns an attempt 
by one of the lowlier members of 
the Syndic itself to become a spy 
on the activities of the Govern- 
ment forces, which conduct their 
piratical activities from bases in 
Iceland, Ireland and elsewhere in 
those regions. He goes through 
innumerable fetching and far- 
fetched adventures, both alone 
and with an attractive girl psy- 
chologist, and eventually dis- 
covers that there is a sort of 
shotgun alliance between Govern- 
ment and Mob forces to over- 
throw the Syndic. 

The payoff is remarkable both 
for its inconclusiveness and for 
its surprisingly philosophical 
depth — an ending rich with les- 
sons for our time. 

AN INTRODUCTION TO 
SYMBOLIC LOGIC by Susanne

T AM told by experts in Sym- 
bolic logic that this is far and 
away the best simple introduction 
to what is today one of the most 
important new tools of scientific 
thought, a way of clear reason- 
ing unsurpassed by any previous 
system. It is not at all difficult to 
read and it seems to strengthen 
and clarify one’s thought pro- 
cesses quite remarkably. 

The book’s value can best be 
summarized by quoting from the 
author’s introduction: “It em- 
phasizes . above all the 
difference between fecund and 
sterile notions ... It seeks to show 
the bearing of logic on natural 
science and philosophy of nature. 
... It aims to take no technical 
knowledge of logic, mathematics 
or science for granted, but to de- 
velop every idea from the level 
of common sense.” 

For anyone interested in learn- 
ing about one of the newer tech- 
niques of basic science, this book 
will prove a fascinating and use- 
ful tool. And, from my own point 
of view, I found it intellectually 
exciting, a real test of some of the 
relatively unused muscles under 
the scalp. 

MORE THAN HUMAN by 
Theodore Sturgeon. Farrar, 
Straus and Young, New York, 
and Ballahtine Books, New York, 
1953. 256 pages, $2.00 cloth, 35c 
paper 



T?EW people who read Stur- 
geon’s “Baby Is Three” in the 
October 1952 galaxy will ever for- 
get its imaginative evocation of 
Homo gestalt, that astonishing 
five-person “person” consisting of 
Janie, the little girl telekineticist- 
telepathist; the Negro twins, 
Bonnie and Beanie, natural-born 
teleporteurs ; Baby, the idiot sa- 
vant computer; and Gerard, the 
boy who coordinated this odd 
group into a cooperating unit 
that could do anything. 

The present book is the full 
flowering of this magically imag- 
ination-stretching concept. It. 
consists of (in addition to “Baby 
Is Three”) a new first section 
telling how the unit originated 
with Lone, the “natural” who 
could never fully develop the new 
unit because he was simple in 
the head, and a new last section 
that describes how Hip Barrows, 
mentally disturbed war veteran, 
finally manages to bring Gerard 
— who could not understand the 
need for morality or ethics in his 
function as “boss” of the Homo 
gestalt unit — to an understand- 
ing of his responsibilities. 

The new parts are fully as im- 
pressive as the original. The 
whole book is a masterpiece of 
invention. 

It is something of a relief to 
find a piece of science fiction that 
is concerned more with odd but 
astonishingly real people and

with parapsychology maturely 
used than with hopeless mobs 
and violent disaster. It is also a 
pleasure to read a book that is 
written in an unmannered prose 
that still has a poetic, panchro- 
matic individuality. And not 
least, it is very rewarding indeed 
to come across an idea that is not 
only unique, but also richly hu- 
man. 

Sturgeon’s second full-length 
novel has more than fulfilled the 
promise shown by his many mas- 
terly short stories. 

SHADOW OF TOMORROW, 
edited by Frederik Pohl. Perma- 
books, New York, 1953. 379 
pages, 35c 

¥ NOTICE a tendency on the 
-*■ part of us reviewers to be- 
come blase and overcritical when 
we report on anthologies — par- 
ticularly the paper-bound bar- 
gains at 35c, like this one. So 
every story is not an immortal 
classic? What do you want for 
the price? Here, for example, we 
have 17 really good stories — 
and where else can you get the 
same amount of acceptable read- 
ing matter for 2c a story? 

This particular book, though, 
is less necessary for the galaxy 
reader than for those not familiar 
with our magazine, since 1 1 of its 
17 items come from the galaxy 
backfile. 



I won’t name every story be- 
cause of space limitations, but 
consider that it includes Hein- 
lein’s “Year of the Jackpot,” Asi- 
mov’s “C-Chute,” Kornbluth’s 
“Marching Morons,” Boucher’s 
“Transfer Point,” Clement’s 
“Halo,” and Eisner (Kornbluth)’s 
“Luckiest Man in Denv” — what 
a list of star items! 

Also John Wyndham’s 
“Perfect Creature” and Blish’s 
“Common Time” — both fine non- 
galaxy tales. And the rest, though 
not quite up to this top level, are 
all good reading, both for the 
convinced fan and the science 
fiction newcomer. 

No stories published before 
1950 are included, which does not 
mean that there are no fine tales 
from that earlier period still to 
be anthologized. This is not in- 
tended as criticism, only as a 
passing comment. 

ASSIGNMENT IN ETERN- 
ITY by Robert Heinlein. Fan- 
tasy Press, Reading, Pa., 1953.

TTERE are four of Heinlein’s 
rather minor efforts, every 
one of them highly readable, but 
none measuring up to his best 
work. 

“Gulf” (1949) deals with a 
struggle between a “good” un- 
derground of Homo superiors, 
complete with telepathy, etc., and 



* it * * * SHELF 



119 



a bunch of “bad” rulers in a 
world of tomorrow. It is full of 
swift-paced excitement. 

“Elsewhen” (1941) is an odd, 
anti-scientific parallel-world tale 
based to some degree on Bishop 
Berkeley’s absurd notions. I 
found it pretty ineffective. 

“Lost Legacy” (1941) is an- 
other story of parapsych’ological 
powers, common now, but rather 
rare when it was written. Its time 
is today. Like “Gulf,” it deals 
with a “totipotent” (to use a van 
Vogtian word) group of conceal- 
ed geniuses (one of them is Am- 
brose Bierce!) who are trying to 
train suitable people to use their 
“whole minds” to subdue the evil 
leaders of Man who seek power 
and power only. It is effective, 
despite the dreamlike nature of 
its plot and especially its char- 
acterizations. 

“Jerry Was a Man” (1947) 
tells of a society in which mutated 
monkeys do the world’s work, 
and how a fantastic millionairess 
with a soft heart gets them recog- 
nized legally as people. It is a 
delightful story, with its jabs at 
pomposity and its understanding 
of what Man basically is — a 
being who can understand the 
difference between right and 
wrong. 

THE SKY BLOCK by Steve 
Frazee. Rinehart and Co., Inc., 
New York, 1953. 247 pages, $2.75 



OTEVE FRAZEE has written 
^ a taut suspense novel with 
science fiction overtones about 
some unnamed enemies of the 
American Way who try to panic 
the country by stopping rain. We 
learn nothing about the nature of 
the drought-making equipment, 
except that it is electronic, but 
we get an almost palpable feeling 
of the terror, the sense of doom, 
that its effects produce. 

Somewhere in Colorado or 
thereabouts is a mountain called 
Blue Peak. Platt Vencel, who was 
brought up there, returns after 
the war for a vacation, to find the 
whole area in the grip of an un- 
precedented drought. Before long, 
he is involved in a frenzied and 
ruthless campaign by the Army, 
the F.B.I., the F.C.C., etc., to 
bring out alive the hidden ene- 
mies holed up somewhere in the 
center of Blue Peak and their 
rain-preventing equipment. The 
task is made almost impossibly 
difficult by the conflicting author- 
ities of the different agencies and 
by the knowledge that any man 
on the hunt may be a traitor. 

The middle of the book sags, 
perhaps because it is impossible 
to maintain continuous excite- 
ment in a situation where there 
can be but little open conflict. On 
the whole, however, I think you 
will find this a satisfyingly spine- 
chilling tale.

THE EDUCATIO 

DRUSILLA 



By THEODORE STURGEON 



Illustrated by ASHMAN 

T HE prison ship, under full 
shields, slipped down to- 
ward the cove, and made 
no shadow on the moonlit water, 
and no splash as it slid beneath 
the surface. They put her out 
and she swam clear, and the ship 
nosed up and silently fled. Two 
wavelets clapped hands softly, 
once, and that was the total 
mark the ship made on the prison 
wall. 

For killing the Preceptor, she 
had been sentenced to life 
prisonment. 

With torture. 

She swam toward the beach un-

til smooth fluid sand touched her 
knee. She stood up. flung her long 
hair back with a single swift mo- 
tion, and waded up the steep 
shingle, one hand lightly touch- 
ing the bulging shoulder of the 
rocks which held the cove in their 
arms. 

Ahead she heard the slightest 
indrawn breath, then a cough. She 
stopped, tall in the moonlight. 
The man took a half-step for- 
ward, then turned his head side- 
wise and a little upward away 
from her, into the moon. 

“I’m — I beg your — sorry,” he 
floundered. 

She sensed his turmoil, extract- 
ed its source, delved for alterna- 
tive acts, and chose the one about 
which he showed the most curious 
conflict. She crouched back into 
the shadows by the rock. 

I didn't see you there. 

“I didn’t see you until you . 
I’m sorry. Why am I standing 
here like this when you . I’ll 
move on down the . I’m sorry.” 

HE took and fanned out 
his impressions, sorted them, 
chose one. My clothes — 

He started away from the 
rocks, looking about him, as if 
he might have been leaning 
against something hot, or some- 
thing holy. “Where are they? Am 
I in the way? Shall I put them 
near the . I’ll just move on 
down.” 



No . no clothes. Directly from 
him she took Where are they? 

“I don’t see any. Somebody 
must’ve — are you sure you 
put them — where did you put 
them?” He was floundering again. 

She caught and used the phrase 
Why, who would . what a 
lowdown trick! 

“Is your— do you have a car 
up there?” he asked, peering up 
at the grassy rim of the beach. 
He added immediately, “But even 
if you got to the car . 

I have no car. 

“My God!” he said indig- 
nantly. “Anybody that would . 
here, what am I standing here 
yapping for? You must be chilled 
to the bone.” 

He was wearing a battered 
trench coat. He whipped it off 
and approached her, three-quar- 
ters backward, the coat dangling 
from his blindly extended arm 
like a torn jib on a bowsprit. She 
took it, shook it out, turned it 
over curiously, then slipped into 
it so that it fell around her the 
way it had covered him. 

Thank you. 

She stepped out of the shad- 
ows, and the huge relief he felt, 
and the admixture of guilty re- 
gret that went with it made her 
smile. 

“Well!” he said, rubbing his 
hands briskly. “That’s better, 
now, isn’t it?” He looked up the 
lonely beach, and down. “Live

around here somewhere?” 

No. 

“Oh.” He said it again, then, 
"Friends bring you down?” he 
asked diffidently. 

She hesitated. Yes. 

"Then they’ll be back for you!” 
She shook her head. He scratch- 
ed his. Suddenly he stepped away 
from her and demanded, “Look, 
you don’t think I had anything 
to do with stealing your clothes, 
do you?” 

Oh, no! 

"Well, all right, because I 
didn’t, I mean I couldn’t do a 
thing like that, even in fun. What 
I was going to say, I mean, now 
I don’t want you to think 
anyth ...” He ground to a stop, 
took a breath and tried again. 
"What I mean is, I have a 
little shack over the rise there. 
You’d be perfectly safe. I have 
no phone, but there’s one a mile 
down the beach. I could go and 
call your friends. I mean I’m not 
one of those . well, look, you 
do just what you think is best.” 
She searched. She felt it 
emerged correctly : I really 

mustn’t put you to that trouble. 
But you’re very kind. 

"I'm not kind. You’d do ex- 
actly the same thing for me, 
now wouldn’t ...” 

He stopped because she was 
laughing silently, her eyes turned 
deep into the corners to look 
at him. She laughed because she 



had sensed his startled laughter 
at what he was saying even be- 
fore it had uncurled. 

"I — can’t say you would at 
that,” he faltered, and then his 
laughter surfaced. By the time it 
had run its course, she was strid- 
ing lithely beside him. 

HPHEY walked for a while in 
silence, until he said, "I do 
the same thing myself, go swim- 
ming in the — I mean without . 
at night. But generally not this 
late in the year.” 

She found this unremarkable 
and made no reply. 

“Uh,” he began, and then fal- 
tered and fell silent again. 

She wondered why he felt it 
so necessary to talk. She probed, 
and discovered that it was be- 
cause he was excited and fright- 
ened and guilty and happy all 
at once, full of little half-finished 
plans concerning cold odds and 
ends of food and the contents of 
a clothes closet, the breathless 
flash of a mental picture of her 
emerging from the water with 
certain details oddly highlighted, 
the quick blanking of the picture 
and the stern frown that did it, 
the timid hope that she did not 
suspect feelings that he could not 
control . Oh, yes, he must talk. 

"You have a — do you mind if 
I say something personal?” 

She looked up attentively. 
"You have a funny sort of way 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



125 



of talking. I mean — ” he leaned 
close — “you hardly move your 
lips when you talk.” 

She turned her head slightly 
and flexed her lips. She made the 
effort and said aloud, “Oh?” 

“Maybe it’s the moonlight,” he 
informed himself. Inwardly he 
pictured her still face and said 
Strange, strange, strange. “What’s 
your name?” 

“Dru. Drusilla,” she said care- 
fully. It was not her name, but 
she had probed and discovered 
that he liked it. “Drusilla 
Strange.” 

“Beautiful,” he breathed. “Say, 
that’s a beautiful name, did you 
know that? Drusilla Strange. 
That’s just . just exactly right.” 
He looked about at the cool white 
blaze of the beach, at the black 
grass under the moon. “Oh!” he 
said abruptly, “I’m Chan. Chand- 
ler Behringer. It’s a clumsy sort 
of name, hard to say, not like — ” 

“Chandler Behringer,” she said. 
“It sounus like a little wind 
catching its tail around a — ” 
she dipped into him swiftly — 
“palm frond.” 

“Huh!” he shouted. It was one 
syllable of a laugh, and it was 
sheer delight. Then he found the 
rest of the laugh. 

He put his hand on her arm 
just above the elbow and steered 
her off the beach. The feel of her 
flesh under the flat close fabric 
caused a shock that ran up his 



arm and straight through his 
defenses. 

“Here’s my place,” he said, 
with all the wind and none of 
the cordal vibration necessary to 
make a voice. He moved away 
from her and marched up the 
slope, frowning, leading the way. 
He ducked into a lean-to porch 
and fumbled too busily with a 
latch. “You’d better wait for a 
moment while I light the lamp. 
It’s sort of cluttered.” 

She waited. The doorway swal- 
lowed him, and there was a fum- 
bling, and a scratching, and 
suddenly the cabin had an in- 
terior. She moved inside. 

“You needn’t be afraid to look 
around,” he said presently, watch- 
ing her. 

S HE did, immediately. She had 
been looking straight at him, 
following his critical inventory of 
the entire place, and she now 
knew it every bit as well as he. 
But, “Oh,” she said, “this is — ” 
she hesitated — “cosy.” 

“A small place,” he said, “but 
it’s dismal.” He laughed, and ex- 
plained apologetically, “I got that 
line from a movie.” 

She sorted out the remark, 
wondered detachedly why he had 
made it, half-heartedly probed 
for the reason, then dropped it as 
unessential effort. 

“A nice soft blanket,” he said, 
lifting it. Her hands went reflex- 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ively to the top button of the 
trench coat and fell away at his 
next words. “When I go out, you 
just wrap yourself up nice and 
snug. I won’t be long. Now give 
me the number.” 

His mental code for “number” 
was so brief and so puzzling — 
a disk with holes in it superim- 
posed on ruled paper — that she 
was quite at a loss. “Number?” 

“Your friends. I’ll phone them. 
They can bring you some clothes, 
take you home.” He laughed self- 
consciously. “I’ll try to say it so 
that ... I mean, make it sound 
. Do you know, I haven’t the 
first idea of just what I’ll tell 
them?” 

“Oh,” she said. “My friends . 
have no phone.” 

“No — oh. What, no phone?” 
He looked at her, around at the 
walls, and inevitably at the bed. 
It was a very small bed. He 
gestured weakly at the door. “A 
. telegram, maybe, but that 
would take a long time, and . 
Oh, I know. I have clothes, dun- 
garees and things. A lumberjack 
shirt. Why didn’t I think of it? 
Girls wear all that kind of — but 
shoes, I don’t know . And then 
I’ll get you a taxi!” he finished 
triumphantly, and the chaos 
within him was, to misuse the 
term, deafening. 

She considered very, very 
carefully and then said, “No taxi 
could take me back. It’s much 



too far for a taxi to travel.” 

“Isn’t there anyone that — ” 

“There isn’t anyone,” she said 
firmly. 

After a long, complicated pause, 
he asked gently, “What hap- 
pened?” 

She averted her face. 

“It was something sad,” he half- 
whispered, and although he was 
quite still, she could feel the 
tendrils of his sympathy reaching 
out toward her. “That’s all right, 
don’t worry. Don’t,” he said loud- 
ly, as if it were the first word 
of a very important pronounce- 
ment; but it would not form. He 
said at last, inanely, “I’ll make 
coffee.” 

He crossed the room, raising 
fiis hand to pat her shoulder as 
he passed, checking it, not touch- 
ing her at all, while the echo of 
that first shock bounded and re- 
bounded within him. He bent 
over the stove, and in a moment 
the evil smell of the lamp, which 
had been pressing closer and 
closer upon her consciousness, 
was eclipsed completely by what 
was to her a completely over- 
powering, classic, catastrophic 
and symphonic stench. Her eye- 
lids flickered and closed as she 
made a tremendous nervous effort 
and at last succeeded in the 
necessary realignment of her car- 
bon-oxygen dynamic. And in a 
moment she could ignore the 
fumes and open her eyes again.

Chan was looking at her. 

“You’ll have to stay.” 

“Yes,” she said. She looked at 
his eyes. “You don’t want me to.” 

“I want you to,” he said hur- 
riedly, “I want . .” He thought 
She's in trouble and she's afraid 
I'm going to take advantage of it. 

“I’m in trouble,” she said, “but 
I’m not afraid you’ll take ad- 
vantage of it.” 

TTE flashed a startling white 
grin. She trusts me. Then the 
grin faded and the internal frown 
clamped down. But it could not 
hide the thought: She’s . she 
expects . she’s maybe the kind 
who . 

“I’m not the kind,” she said 
levelly, “who — ” 

“Oh, I know I know I know!” 
he interrupted rapidly, and with 
it he thought Why is she so 
damned sure of herself? 

“I just don’t know what to do!” 
she said. 

He smiled again. “You just 
leave everything to me. We’ll 
make out fine, I mean you’re 
quite safe, you know. And in the 
morning everything will look a 
lot brighter. Oh, that coat, that 
wet old coat. Here,” he bustled, 
“here — here.” 

From curtained clothes-pole 
and paper-lined orange crate came 
blue denims, a spectral holocaust 
in woolen plaid, a pair of socks 
of a red that did not belong 




within four miles of any color 
in the shirt. She looked at the 
clothes and at him. He turned his 
back. 

“I’ll go on with the . cook- 
cook-coffee and you know,” he 
said nervously. 

She took off the trench coat

and while her fingers solved the 
logical problem called buttons 
and the topological one whereby 
a foot enters a sock, she pondered 
Chandler Behringer’s extraor- 
dinary sensitivities. Either this 
species must overpopulate its 
planet in nine generations, she 



thought whimsically, or it must 
die from nervous exhaustion in 
four. The dungarees gouged and 
rasped her skin until she damped 
its sensitivity, but the feel of the 
heavy, washed wool of the shirt 
was delightful. 

He set out plates and in a 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



129 



moment slid a handsome orange- 
and-white edible onto them. She 
looked at it with interest, and 
then her eyes traveled to the 
small table by the stove, and she 
saw the shells. By the Fountain 
Itself, she said silently, eggs! 
They eat EGGS! 

She forced her feelings into a 
desensitized compartment of her 
mind and corked it. Then she sat 
opposite Chandler and ate hearti- 
ly. The coffee was bitter and, to 
her palate, gritty, but she drank 
her second cup with composure. 
He's so very pleased that I eat 
with him, she thought. They 
probably do everything gregari- 
ously, even where cooperation is 
not involved. She was conscious 
of no disgust, for that, too, was 
insulated — and so it must stay 
for the rest of her imprisonment, 
which is to say the rest of her 
life. 

The food seemed to have re- 
laxed him; a sphygmomanetic 
allocation, she deduced. And in- 
voluntary. How very confining. 
His chatter had eased and he was 
taking a silent pleasure in watch- 
ing her. When she met his eyes 
finally, he leaped up nervously 
and scraped and washed the 
plates energetically. He thought, 
7 wonder if she liked it. And: 
She knows how to be a guest, 
and how to keep herself from 
plunging into the dish-washing, 
putting them back in the wrong 



place and all. And: I like doing 
things for her. I wish I could do 
everything for . And then the 
frown. 

Suddenly in a rush of embar- 
rassment and self -accusation, he 
spun around and said, “I haven’t 
even asked you, I mean told you, 
if you, I mean, well, this is just 
a shack and we haven’t all the 
fixtures.’’ 

She looked at him blankly, 
then probed. 

Oh. This is loaded, too. But 
not eating. Amazing. 

She made it as easy for him as 
she could. She rose and gave him 
the quick nervous smile that was 
correct. 

“It’s outside,” he said. “To 
your left. That little path.” 

She slipped outside, stalked 
directly down to the water’s edge 
and with as little effort and even 
less distress than a polite cough 
might have cost her, she vomited 
up the eggs and the coffee. She 
had eaten, after all, only two 
days ago. 

H E had the bed made up when 
she came in, the pillow 
smooth, crisp sheets flat and 
diagonally folded at the head end. 

“I bet you’re as tired as I am,” 
he said. “And that’s a whole 
lot.” 

“Oh,” she said, looking at the 
bed. For sleeping! What would 
she want sleep for? Because of a 



130

phylic habit unbroken in these 
savages since they were forced 
to spend the dark hours immo- 
bile in a rocky hole to save them- 
selves from nocturnal carnivores? 
But she said, “Oh, how neat. But 
I can’t take your bed. I’ll sit 
up.” 

“You’ll do no such thing,” he 
said severely, and her eyes wid- 
ened. He busied himself with a 
blanket roll and sleeping bag, 
which he put on the floor just 
as far — four feet or so — as it 
could possibly go from the bed. 
“I love this old bag. Look, nylon 
and down — the only expensive 
thing I own. Except my guitar.” 

She visualized “guitar” and im- 
mediately put it down as some- 
thing to investigate. The flash she 
got in his coding was brief, but 
sufficient for her to recognize 
its size, shape and purpose, and 
to conclude that although its 
resonant volumes were gross and 
its vents inaccurately placed, it 
was closer to the engineering she 
knew and understood than most 
things she had glimpsed here so 
far. 

“You didn’t tell me you played 
the guitar,” she said politely. 

“I get paid for it,” he said, 
yawning, and she knew that this 
yawn belonged to this remark and 
not to the circumstance of som- 
nolence. “Ready for bed?” 

Patiently she bowed to his 
formalities. “You’re very kind.” 



He went to the lamp and turned 
it out. The low moon streamed 
in. 

H E hesitated, slid into his 
sleeping bag after removing 
only his shoes. There ensued a 
considerable amount of flounder- 
ing, ducking, and thumping on 
the floor, and at last he brought 
his trousers out, folded as small 
as possible. He wadded them be- 
tween the corner of the sleeping 
bag and the wall as if they were 
a secret. Then he sat up and took 
off his shirt. He hung it on the 
corner of the window sill, lay 
down, zipped the bag up to his 
neck, and ostentatiously turned 
on his side with his face to the 
wall. “Good night.” 

“Good night,” she said. Re- 
signedly she got between the 
sheets, as indicated by the folded- 
down corner, pulled up the blank- 
et, porpoised out of her trousers, 
folded them, brought them out 
and hid them; removed her shirt, 
reached out a long arm and hung 
it on the other corner of the 
window sill. Did he still have 
his socks on? He did. She wrig- 
gled her toes and slightly de- 
sensitized her ankles where the 
weave pressed them. 

“You’re perfectly safe. Don’t 
worry about a thing.” 

“Thank you, Chan. I feel safe. 
I’m not worried. Good night.” 
“Good night. Dru,” he said 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



131 



suddenly, lifting himself on one 
elbow. 

“What is it?” 

He lay down again. “Good 
night.” 

She watched with deep interest 
the downward spiralings of his 
thoughts into the uprising tides of 
sleep. It happened to him sud- 
denly, and the “noise” factor of 
his conscious presence slumped 
away out of the room. 

And the torture began. 

S HE had known it was there, 
but Chandler Behringer was 
a fine foil for it. He alleviated 
nothing, but he set up a con- 
stant distraction purely by the 
bumbling, burrowing busyness of 
his mind. Now it had faded to 
a whisper, to an effective nothing, 
and her torture poured down on 
her. From the warp-shielded, in- 
detectible satellites which guard- 
ed the prison planet and 
administered the punishment, ag- 
ony poured down to her. 

Thus it will be tonight, and 
the next and next nights, and 
every night for all of my own 
forever. Hushed in the day and 
hungry and sweet at night, it 
will rain down on me. And I can 
lie and relax, and I can harbor 
my anger and anchor my anguish, 
but the tide will rise, the cur- 
rents will tug until they break 
me, if it takes two hundred years. 
And when I’m broken by it, the 




132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




DRUSILLA STRANGE 



133 



torture will go on and on — and on. 

Most of the torture was music. 

Some of the torture was singing. 

And a little of the torture was 
a thing hardly describable in 
Earthly terms, which made pic- 
tures — not on a screen, not on 
the mind like memories, however 
poignant — but pictures so clear 
and true that the sudden whip of 
a pennant brought, a second later, 
spent wind to buffet the eyelids, 
pictures wherein one walked 
barefoot on turf and knew a 
mottling of heat and coolth in the 
arches, with the moisture of the 
grass its broken green bleeding. 
These were pictures where to 
loose a sling was to know 
the draw of the pectorals and the 
particled bite of soil under the 
downdriven toenails, and to pic- 
ture a leap was to kick away a 
very planet, to have that price- 
less quarter-second of absolute 
float, and to come back to a cush- 
ioning of one’s own litheness. 

This was music of an ancient 
planet peopled by a race far older. 
This was music with the soft- 
ness and substance of weathered 
granite, and the unwinding in- 
tricacies of a fern. It was fero- 
cious music with a thick-wristed 
control of its furies so sure that 
it could be used for laughter. 
And altogether it was music that 
rose and cycled and bubbled and 
built like the Fountain Itself. 

This was the high singing of 



birds beauty-lost in altitude, and 
the heavier, upward voices ex- 
pressed by the reaching of trees. 
It was the voice of the tendon 
burst for being less strong than 
the will, and the heart of the 
sea, and its base was the bass of 
pulsations of growth (for even a 
shouldering tree trunk has a note, 
if listened to for years enough) 
and altogether these were the 
voices? that made and were made 
by the Fountain Itself. 

And these were the pictures of 
the Fountain Itself . 

And such were the tortures of 
those who were exiled, imprisoned 
and damned. 

She lay there and hated the 
moonlight; the moon she regarded 
as ugly and vulgar and new. It 
seemed to her an added lash, as 
were all things similar and all 
things contrasting to the world 
she had lost. She turned eyes 
grown cold on the sleeping man, 
and curled her lip; the creature 
was a clever counterpart, a subtle 
caricature, of the worst of the 
men of her race, in no way per- 
fect, in no way magnificent, but 
in no way so crude an artifact 
as to permit her to forget what 
was surely its original. 

By comparison and by contrast, 
Earth, this muddy, uncouth ball 
of offal, pinioned her soul to her 
home. Earth had everything that 
could be found on her world — 
after a fashion — racecourses com- 



134

paratively an armspan wide, rac- 
ing dun rats ridden by newts in 
sleazy silks . men whose eyes 
sparkled in the sun not quite as 
much as her racial brother’s 
might when he, with only his 
shaded hand to help him, sought 
and found a ghostly nebula. 

C ELL by interlocking cell, ion 
by osmotic particle, she be- 
longed elsewhere. And Earth, 
which was her world falsified; 
and the endless music, which was 
her world in truth — these would 
never let her forget it. 

So she cursed the moonbeams 
and the music sliding down them, 
and swore that she would not be 
broken. She could soak herself 
in this petty planet, zip it up 
to her neck to conceal anything 
of her real self in her pettiest 
acts; she could don the bearing 
and the thoughts themselves of 
Earth’s too-fine, too-empty pup- 
pets — and still inwardly she 
would be herself, a citizen of her 
world, part of the Fountain Itself. 
As long as she was that, in any 
fiber, she could not be completely 
an exile. Excommunicated she 
might be; bodily removed, wing- 
less and crawling, trembling un- 
der the dear constant breath of 
her home; but until she broke, 
her jailers had failed for all their 
might and righteousness. 

The sun rose and turned her 
away from her bitterness, a little. 



Chan’s sleeping consciousness 
came close and roared around 
her, fell back into blacknesses. 
She rose and went to the door. 
The sea was rose -gold and 
breathing and the sun was aloft, 
a shade too near, too yellow, and 
too small. She damned it heartily 
with a swift thought that spouted 
and spread and hung in the air 
like the mist from a fountain, 
and went and dressed. 

She glanced at the percolator, 
understood it, and deftly made 
coffee. At its first whisper in the 
tube, Chan sighed and his con- 
sciousness came upward with a 
rush. Drusilla slipped outside. 
Patience she had in full measure, 
but she felt it unworthy to tap 
it for such unwieldy formalities 
as she knew she must witness 
if she stayed in the room during 
the cracking of his nylon chrysa- 
lis. 

There was a hoarse shout from 
inside, a violent floundering, and 
then Chandler Behringer ap- 
peared. He was tousled and 
frightened. His panic, she noted, 
had been sufficient to drive him 
outdoors without his shirt, but 
not without his trousers. He 
squeezed his eyelids so tight shut 
that his cheekbones seemed to 
rise; then opened them and saw 
her standing by the beach mar- 
gin. The radiance that came from 
his face competed for a moment 
with the early tilting sunlight. 



DRUSILLA STRANGE

“I thought you’d gone.” 

She smiled. “No.” 

She came to him. His eyes de- 
voured her. He raised both hands 
together and placed them, one 
on the other, on his left collar- 
bone. She understood that he was 
concealing the vestigial nipples 
(which were absent in males of 
her race) with his wrists. She ex- 
amined this reflex with some curi- 
osity, and filed away for future 
puzzlement the fact that he did 
this because he wore trousers; 
had they been bathing trunks, the 
reflex would not have appeared. 
He took a breath so deep that 
she empathized his pain. 

“You are the most beautiful 
woman I have ever seen,” he said. 

She did not doubt it, and had 
no comment. 

“The most beautiful woman 
who ever lived,” he murmured. 

Abruptly she turned her back, 
and now it was her eyes which 
squeezed shut. “I am not!” she 
said in a tone so saturated with 
hatred and violence that he 
stepped back almost into the 
doorway. 

Without another word she 
strode off, down the beach, her 
direction chosen solely by the 
way she happened to be facing 
at the time. In a moment she was 
conscious of his feet padding after 
her. 

“Dru, Dru, don’t go!” he pant- 
ed. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean, 



hah! to do anything that hah! 
oh, I was only — ” 

She stopped and turned so 
abruptly that had he taken two 
more steps they would have col- 
lided. Far from taking steps, how- 
ever, he had all he could do to 
stay upright. 

S HE stood looking at him, un- 
moving. On her face was no 
particular expression; but there 
was that in the high-held head, 
the slightly distended nostrils, 
the splendid balance of her stance, 
and her gracefully held, power- 
ful hands that made approach 
impossible. His eyes were quite 
round and his lips slightly parted. 
He extended one hand and moved 
his mouth silently, then let the 
hand fall. His knees began to 
tremble visibly. 

She turned again and walked 
away. He stood there for a long 
time watching her go. When she 
was simply a brilliant fleck on the 
brightening dunes, the purpose- 
less hand came forward again. 

“Dru?” he said, in a voice soft- 
ened to soprano inaudibility by 
all the cautions of awe. And she 
was gone, and he turned slowly, 
as if he had a tall and heavy 
weight on his rounded shoulders, 
and plodded back to the cabin. 

She found a road which paral- 
leled the beach and climbed to it. 
Fools cluster about the Universe, 
she thought, like bubbles about 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the fountain pool, shifting and 
pulsing at random, without de- 
sign, purpose or function. She 
had left such a fool and she was 
such a fool. There was far more 
culpability in her folly than in 
that of the man. He had little 
control over what he might say, 
and less understanding, because 
of his nature and his limitations. 
Neither his faculties nor his con- 
ditioning could enable him to un- 
derstand why she felt such fury. 

She stabbed her heels into the 
sandy roadbed as she walked. She 
ground her teeth. The most beau- 
tiful woman who ever lived . 

Her beauty! 

Where, exile — where, criminal, 
has your beauty brought you? 

She strode on, her mood so 
black it all but eclipsed the tor- 
ture music. 

Perhaps fifteen minutes later, 
she became conscious of a shrill 
ultrasonic, a rapidly pulsing, 
urgent, growing thing that would 
be a silence to all but her. She 
slowed, stopped finally. The 
sound came from behind her, but 
she would not confuse her analy- 
sis by looking back. She listened 
as an intervening wind carried 
the vibrations away and then let 
them come back again, nearer, 
stronger. She sensitized her bare 
feet; she raised an arm and took 
the vibrations on the back of her 
hand. She became conscious of 
synchronous sounds.

Something rotated at approxi- 
mately thirty-eight hundred and 
forty rpm. Something was chain- 
driven and the chain was not a 
metal. Something pounded . 
no, paced — something rolled end- 
less soft cleats on the earth. She 
heard the straining of coil springs, 
the labored slide of heavy trans- 
verse leaf-springs, the make-and- 
break in the meniscus of the oil 
guarding busy pistons. 

The utter stupidity of so com- 
plex a thing as an automobile 
was, to her, more wondrous than 
a rainbow. 

At last she turned to look, 
and in a moment she saw it climb 
a rise some two mifes away. The 
piercing ultrasonic was beyond 
bearing, and she adjusted her 
hearing to eliminate everything 
between eighty-six and eighty- 
eight thousand cycles. 

ltyTORE comfortable now, she 

waited patiently. The car 
slid down a straight and gentle 
grade toward her, spitting sun- 
light through its chromium teeth, 
palming aside the morning air 
and pressing it back and down 
its sleek flanks, while underneath, 
where there was np hint of fair- 
ing, air shocked and roiled and 
shuddered and troubled what dust 
it could find in the sandy road. 
It was a very large and very new 
car. Drusilla watched it, wide- 
eyed. She, came to wonder what 
. \l

conclusions one would have re- 
garding these — these savages, if 
one knew nothing of them but 
such a vehicle. What manner of 
man streamlines only where he 
can see? 

The lovely thought, then: It’s 
a world of clowns. 

She smiled; the driver saw it 
and his foot came down on the 
brake pedal. The car threw down 
its glittering baroque nose, slid a 
hand’s breadth, and lowered it- 
self sitzwise into its warm bath 
of springs. 

The driver’s eyes were long and 
flat and his nose and chin were 
sharp. Drusilla watched what he 
was doing, which was watching 
himself watch her. 

Suddenly he said, “How far is 
it to — ” and before the first word 
was spoken, she knew he was 
completely familiar with these 
roads. 

She said, “Your — ” and raised 
her hand to point accurately at 
the hood, while she searched him 
for the term. “Your rocker-arm’s 
not getting oil. The third one 
from the front.” Even while the 
motor idled, the soundless shriek 
of that dry friction would have 
been unbearable had she let it. 

“Sounds all right to me,” he 
shrugged. He looked — he jour- 
neyed, rather — down from her 
eyes, down until he saw that her 
feet were bare. He left his gaze 
where it was and said, “Let me 



give you a lift.” He half turned 
then, reached one thin spidery 
arm back and across without 
looking, and the rear door swung 
open. 

Drusilla took one step forward 
and only then saw that the man 
was not alone in the car. She 
stopped, amazed — not at the 
woman who sat there, but at the 
fact that perceptions such as hers 
had missed so much. She glanced 
at the man, and realized that it 
was his feeling, or lack of it, that 
had numbed and blinded her to 
everything about the woman who 
sat beside him. She was com- 
panion reduced to presence, mini- 
fied to fixture, reduced to a very 
limbo of familiarity. Drusilla 
stared at her, and the woman 
stared back. 

She was a small woman, com- 
pact, so coiffed and clad that 
she was only a blandness. What 
kept her from being featureless 
as an egg was a pair of achingly 
blue eyes large enough for a be- 
ing half again her size, and 
a perfect mouth painted such a 
transcendental, pupil - shrinking 
red that surely it would melt 
fuse-wire. Her wide eyes were 
blank. 

To Drusilla’s horror, a growth 
like an iridescent liver sprang 
into being between the flaming 
lips, grew to the size of a fist and 
collapsed limply. The lips parted, 
a pink tongue deftly caught, 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cleared, and drew the limp matter 
back between an even flicker of 
paper-white teeth. And again the 
face was molded and smooth and 
motionless. 

“My wife,” said the man, “so 
you’re chaperoned. My God, Lu, 
you got bubble gum again.” The 
woman took her gaze away from 
Drusilla and placed it on the 
driver, but there was otherwise no 
change. “Get in.” 

■piRUSILLA’S mind played 
back a fleeting inner sensa- 
tion she had taken from him 
when he had said “My wife.” It 
was . pride? No. Admiration? 
Hardly! Compliment; that was it. 
This woman was a compliment he 
paid himself. He had no tiny 
fleck of doubt that he was ad- 
mired for her careful finish. 

The big blue eyes swung to 
her again and she probed. 

For a ghastly micro-second, 
she had all the sensations of 
walking into a snakepit with 
chloroform on her scarf. She re- 
coiled violently, moved far back 
to the low bank; and she shud- 
dered. 

“Come on, uh, hey, what’s the 
matter?” the driver called. 

Drusilla shook her head twice, 
not so much in refusal as in an 
attempt to escape from something 
that was laying clammy strands 
of silk on her face and hair. With- 
out another word, she turned and 



walked away down the road, be- 
hind the car. 

“Hey!” 

Drusilla did not look back. 

He started the car and drove 
off slowly. In a moment, the 
woman leaned forward and 
tugged hard on the wheel. The 
car heeled back on the road, 
and at last he took his eyes from 
the rear view minor. 

“Now what’s with her?” he de- 
manded of the windshield wiper. 

Lu blew another bubble. 

When the car was gone, Dru- 
silla went slowly back and past 
the place she had met it, and on 
toward the town. From her mar- 
row she swore a mighty oath that 
never again would she be trapped 
into sending her probes into such 
a revolting mess. The driver 
hadn’t been like that; Chan 
Behringer hadn’t. Yet she knew 
with a terrible certainty that 
there must be thousands like that 
creature here on the prison planet. 

So as she walked she devised 
something, a hair-triggered syn- 
aptic structure, a reaction pat- 
tern that could, even without her 
conscious knowledge, detect the 
faintest beginnings of a presence 
such as this; and it would snap 
down her shields, isolate her, pro- 
tect her, keep her clean. 

She was badly shaken. The 
presence of that woman had 
shaken her, but the most dev- 
astating thing of all was the 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



139 



knowledge that she could be 
shaken. It was a realization most 
difficult for her to absorb; it had 
little precedent in her cosmos. 
Walking, she shuddered again. 

D RUSILLA came to the town 
and wandered until she found 
a restaurant which needed a 
waitress. She borrowed the price 
of a pair of beach sandals from 
the weary cashier and went to 
work. She found a little room 
and at the end of the second day 
she had the price of a cotton 
dress. 

In the second week she was a 
stenographer and, in the second 
month, secretary to the head of 
a firm which made boat-sails and 
awnings. She invested quietly, 
sold some poems, a song, two ar- 
ticles and a short story. In terms 
of her environment, she did very 
well indeed, very fast. In her own 
estimate, she did nothing but 
force her attention randomly 
away from her torture. 

For the torture, of course, con- 
tinued. She bore it with outward 
composure, shucked it off as casu- 
ally as, from time to time, she 
changed her name, her job, her 
hair-styling and her accent. But 
like the lessons she learned, like 
the knowledge of the people she 
met and worked with, the torture 
accumulated. She could estimate 
her capacity for it. It was large, 
but not infinite. She could get rid 



of none of it, any more than she 
could get rid of knowledge. It 
could be compacted and stored. 
As long as she could do this with 
the torture, she was undefeated. 
But she was quite capable of cal- 
culating intake against capacity 
and she had not much time. A 
year and a half, two . 

She would stand at the win- 
dow, absorbing her punishment, 
staring up into the night sky with 
her bright wise eyes. She could 
not see the guardian ships, of 
course, but she knew they were 
there. She knew of their killer- 
boats which could, if necessary, 
slip down in moments and blast 
a potential escapee, or one about 
to violate the few simple rules 
of a prisoner’s conduct. 

Sometimes, objectively, she 
marveled at the cruel skill of the 
torture. Music alone, with its in- 
effable spectrum of sadness and 
longing and wild nostalgic joy, 
could have been enough and 
more than enough for a prisoner 
to bear; but the sensory pictures, 
the stimulative and restimulative 
flow and change of taste and mo- 
tion and all the subtleties of the 
kinetic senses — these, mixed 
and mingled with music, charging 
in where music lulled, marching 
in the footprints of the music’s 
rhythmic stride — these were the 
things which laughed at her bar- 
riers, sparred with her, giggling; 
met her fists with a breeze, her

rapier with a gas, her advances 
with a disappearance. 

There was no fighting attacks 
like these. Ignorance would have 
been a defense, but was of no 
use to her who was so nerve - 
alive to all the torture’s sense and 
symbolism. All she could do was 
to absorb, compact, and hope that 
she could find a defense before 
she broke. 

CO she lived and outwardly 
^ prospered. She met some hu- 
mans who amused her briefly, 
and others she avoided after one 
or two meetings because they re- 
minded her so painfully of her 
own people — a smile, a stride, a 
matching of colors. If she met 
any others with the terrifying 
quality of the woman in the car, 
she was not aware of it; that part 
of her defense, at least, was secure. 

But the torture still poured 
down upon her, and after half a 
year she knew she must take some 
steps to counteract it. At base, 
the solution was simple. If she 
did nothing, the torture would 
crush her, and there was no sur- 
cease in that, for having broken, 
she would go on suffering it. She 
could kill herself, but that in it- 
self would fulfill the terms of her 
sentence — “life imprisonment — 
with torture.” There was only one 
way — to be killed, and to be 
killed by the guardians. She was 
not under a death sentence. If 



she forced one, they would have 
to violate their own penalty, and 
she would be able to die unbrok- 
en, as befits a Citizen of the Foun- 
tain Itself. 

More and more she studied the 
sky, knowing of the undetectible 
presence of the guardians and 
their killer-boats, knowing that 
if she could think of it, there 
must be a way to bring one of 
them careening silently down on 
her to snuff her out. She made 
sendings of many kinds — even 
of the kind she had used to ex- 
tinguish the life-force of the Pre- 
ceptor — without altering the 
quality or degree of torture in 
the slightest. 

Perhaps the guardians sent, but 
did not receive; perhaps nothing 
could touch them. Geared to the 
pattern of a Citizen’s mind and 
conditioning, they patiently pro- 
duced that which must, in time, 
destroy it. The destruction would 
be because of the weakness of 
the attacked. Drusilla wanted to 
be destroyed through the strength 
of the attacker. The distinction 
was, to her, clear and vital. 

There had to be a way, if only 
she could think of it. 

There was, and she did. 

TTE came onstage grinning like 
a boy, swinging his guitar 
carelessly. The set was a living 
room. He plumped down on a 
one-armed easychair and hooked 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



141 



a brown-and-white hassock to- 
ward him with his heel. There 
was applause. 

“Thank you, Mother,” said 
Chan Behringer. He slipped the 
plectrum from under the first and 
second strings. Dru thought Your 
low D is one one-hundred-twenty- 
eighth tone sharp. 

Deftly, out of sight of the audi- 
ence, he plugged in the pickup 
cable. Dru watched attentively. 
She had never seen a twelve- 
string guitar before. 

He began to play. He played 
competently, with neither mis- 
takes nor imagination. There was 
a five-stage amplifier built into 
his chair and a foot-pedal tone 
control and electronic vibrato in 



the hassock. A rough cutoff at 
twenty-seven thousand cycles, 
she realized, and then remember- 
ed that, to most humans, response 
flat to eight thousand is high 
fidelity. 

She was immensely pleased 
with the electrical pickups; she 
had not noticed them at first, 
which was a compliment to him. 
One was magnetic, sunk into the 
fingerboard at the fourteenth fret. 
The other was a contact micro- 
phone, obviously inside the box, 
directly under the bridge. The 
either-or-both switch was audible 
when he moved it, which she 
thought disgraceful. 

He finished his number, drawl- 
ed a few lines of patter, asked for 




142

and played a couple of requests 
and an encore, by which time 
Drusilla had left the theater and 
was talking to the stage doorman. 
He took the paper parcel she 
handed him and sent it to the 
dressing rooms via the callboy. 

In a matter of seconds, there 
was a wild whoop from backstage 
and Chan Behringer came bound- 
ing down the iron steps, clutch- 
ing a wild flannel shirt, a pair of 
blue dungarees, and some tatters 
of paper and string. 

“Dru! Dru!” he gasped. He ran 
to her, his arms out. 'Then he 
stopped, faltered, put his head 
very slightly to one side. “Dru,” 
he said again, softly. 

“Hello, Chan.” 

“I never thought I’d see you 
again.” 

“I had to return your things.” 

“Too good to be true,” he mur- 
mured. “I — we — ” Suddenly 
he turned to the goggling doorman 
and tossed the clothes to him. 
“Hang on to these for me, will 
you, George?” To Drusilla he 
said, “I should take ’em back- 
stage, but I’m afraid to let you 
out of my sight.” 

“I won’t run away again.” 

“Let’s get out of here,” he said. 
He took her arm, and again there 
was the old echo of a shock he 
had once felt at the touch of her 
flesh through fabric. 

They went to a place, all soft 
lights and leather, and they talk- 



ed about the beach and the city 
and show business and guitar 
music, but not about her strange 
fury with him the morning she 
had stalked out of his life. 

“You’ve changed,” he said at 
length. 

“Have I?” 

“You were like — like a queen 
before. Now you’re like a prin- 
cess.” 

“That’s sweet.” 

“More . .’ . human.” 

She laughed. “I wasn’t exactly 
human when you first met me. 
I’d had a bad time. I’m all right 
now, Chan. I — didn’t want to 
see you until I was all right.” 

They talked until it was time 
for his next act, and after that 
they had dinner. 

She saw him the next day, and 
the next. 

rpHE chubby man with a face 
like a cobbler and hands like 
a surgeon made the most beauti- 
ful guitars in the world. He 
sprang to his feet when the tall 
girl came in. It was the first time 
he had paid such a courtesy in 
fourteen years. 

“Can you cut an F-slot that 
looks like this?” she demanded. 

He looked at the drawing she 
laid on the counter, grunted, then 
said, “Sure, lady. But why?” 

She launched into a discussion 
which, at first, he did not hear, 
for it was in his field and in his 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



143 



language and he was too aston- 
ished to think. But once into it, 
he very rapidly learned things 
about resonance, harmonic rein- 
forcement, woods, varnishes and 
reverse-cantilever designs that 
were in no book he had ever 
heard about. 

When she left a few minutes 
later, he hung gasping to the 
counter. In front of him was a 
check for work ordered. In his 
hand was a twenty-dollar bill for 
silence. In his mind was a flame 
and a great wonderment. 

She spilled a bottle of nail- 
polish remover on Chan’s guitar. 
He was kind and she was patheti- 
cally contrite. It was all right, he 
said; he knew a place that could 
retouch it before evening. They 
went there together. The little 
man with the cobbler’s face hand- 
ed over the new instrument, a 
guitar with startling slots, an 
ultra -precision bridge, a finger- 
board that crept into his hand as 
if it were alive and loved him. He 
chorded it once, and at the tone 
he put it reverently down and 
stared. His eyes were wet. 

“It’s yours,” Drusilla twinkled. 
“Look — your name inlaid on the 
neck-back.” 

“I know your guitars,” said 
Chan to the chubby man, “but 
I never heard of anything like 
this.” 

“Tricks to every trade,” said 
the man, and winked. 



Drusilla slipped him another 
twenty as they left. 

rpHE electronics engineer stared 
-*■ at the schematic diagram. “It 
won’t work.” 

“Yes, it will,” said Drusilla. 
“Can you build it?” 

“Well, gosh, yes, but who ever 
heard of voltage control like 
this? Where’s the juice supposed 
to go from ...” He leaned closer. 
“Well, I’ll be damned. Who de- 
signed this?” 

“Build it,” she said. 

He did. It worked. Drusilla 
wired it into the prop armchair 
and Chan never knew anything 
had been changed. He attributed 
everything to the new instrument 
as he became more familiar with 
it and began to exploit its pos- 
sibilities. Suddenly there were no 
more layoffs. No more road trips, 
either. The clubs began to take 
important notice of the shy young 
man with the tear-your-heart-out 
guitar. 

She stole his vitamin pills and 
replaced them with something 
else. She invited him to dinner at 
her apartment and he fainted in 
the middle of the fish course. 

He came to seven hours later 
on the couch, long after the 
strange induction baker and the 
rack of impulse hypodermics had 
been hidden away. He remember- 
ed absolutely nothing. He was 
lying on his left arm and it ached.

Dru told him he had fallen 
asleep and she had just let him 
sleep it out. 

“Poor dear, you’ve been work- 
ing too hard.” 

He told her somewhat harshly 
that she must never let him sleep 
like that, cutting off the circula- 
tion in his fingering arm. 

The next day, the arm was 
worse and he had to cancel a 
date. On the third day, it was 
back to normal, one hundred per 
cent, and on the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth days it continued to im- 
prove. And what it could do on 
the fingerboard was past descrip- 
tion. Which was hardly surpris- 
ing : there was not another arm on 
Earth like it, with its heavier 
nerve-fibers, the quadrupling of 
the relay-nodes on the medullary 
sheaths, the low-resistance, super- 
reactive axones, and the isotopic 
potassium and sodium which 
drenched them. 

“I don’t play this damn thing 
any more,” he said. “I just think 
the stuff and that left hand reads 
my mind.” 

TTE made three records in three 
months, and the income from 
them increased cubically each 
time. Then the record company 
decided to save money and put 
him under a long-term contract 
at a higher rate than anyone had 
ever been paid before. 

Chan, without consulting Dru- 



silla, bought one of a cluster of 
very exclusive houses just over 
the city line. The neighbors on 
the left were the Kerslers, whose 
grandfather had made their mon- 
ey in off-the-floor sanitary fix- 
tures. The neighbors on the right 
were the Mullings — you know, 
Osprey Mullings, the writer, two 
books a year, year in and year 
out, three out of four of them 
making Hollywood. 

Chan invited the Kerslers and 
the Mullings to his housewarm- 
ing, and took Drusilla out there 
to surprise her. 

She was surprised, all right. 
Kersler had a huge model rail- 
road in his cellar and his mind 
likewise contained a great many 
precise minutiae, only one of 
which was permitted to operate 
at a time. Grace Kersler’s mind 
was like an empty barn solidly 
lined with pink frosting. Osprey 
Mullings’ head contained a set 
of baby’s blocks of limited num- 
ber, with which he constructed his 
novels by a ritualistic process of 
rearrangement. But Luellen 
Mullings was the bland-faced 
confection who secretly chewed 
bubble gum and who had so jolt- 
ed Drusilla that day on the 
beach road. 

It was a chatty and charming 
party, and it was the very first 
time that humans had been cap- 
able of irritating Drusilla so much 
that she had to absorb the an- 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



noyance rather than ignore it. 
She bore this attack on her wan- 
ing capacities with extreme gra- 
ciousness, and at parting, the 
Kerslers and the Mullings pressed 
Chan’s hand and wished him luck 
with that beautiful Drusilla 
Strange, you lucky fellow you. 

And late at night, full to burst- 
ing with success and security and 
a fine salting of ambition, Chan 
drove her back to town and at 
her apartment, he proposed to 
her. 

She held both his hands and 
cried a little, and promised to 
work with him and to help him 
even more in the future — but, 
“Please, please, Chan, never ask 
me that again.” 

He was hurt and baffled, but 
he kept his promise. 

^’HAN studied music seriously 
now — he never had before. He 
had to. He was giving concerts 
rather than performances, and he 
played every showcase piece ever 
composed by one virtuoso to 
madden and frustrate the others. 
He played all of the famous vio- 
lin cadenzi on his guitar as well. 
He made arrangements of the 
arrangements. He did all this 
with the light contempt of a 
Rubinstein examining a two dol- 
lar lesson in chord-vamping. So 
at length he had no recourse but 
to compose. Some of his stuff was 
pretty advanced. All of it took 



you by the throat and held you. 

One Sunday afternoon, “Try 
this,” said Drusilla. She hummed 
a tone or two, then burst into a 
cascade of notes that brought 
Chan up standing. 

“God, Dru!” 

“Try it,” she said. 

He got his guitar. His left hand 
ran over the fingerboard like a 
perplexed little animal, and he 
struck a note or two. 

“No,” she said, “this.” She 
sang. 

“Oh,” he whispered. Watching 
her, he played. When she seemed 
not pleased, he stopped. 

“No,” she said. “Chan, I can 
only sing one note at a time. You 
have twelve strings.” She paused, 
thoughtfully, listening. “Chan, if 
I asked you to play that theme, 
and then to — to paint pictures on 
it with your guitar, would that 
make sense?” 

“You usually make sense.” 

She smiled at him. “All right. 
Play that theme, and with it, play 
the way a tree grows. Play the 
way the bud leads the twig and 
the twig cuts up into space to 
make a hole for the branch. No,” 
she said quickly, as his eyes 
brightened and his right thumb 
and forefinger tightened on the 
plectrum, “not yet. There’s more.” 
He waited. 

She closed her eyes. Almost in- 
audibly, she hummed something. 
Then she said, “At the same time, 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



147 



put in all the detail of a tree that 
has already grown.” She opened 
her eyes and looked straight at 
him. ‘‘That will consolidate,” she 
said factually, ‘‘because a tree is 
only the graphic trajectory of its 
buds.” 

He looked at her strangely. 
‘‘You’re quite a girl.” 

“Never mind that,” she said 
quickly. “Now put those three 
things together with a fountain. 
And that’s all.” 

“What kind of a fountain?” 
She paled, but her voice was 
easy. “Silly. The only kind of 
fountain that could be with that 
theme, the tree growing, and the 
tree grown.” 

He struck a chord. “I’ll try.” 
She hummed for him, then 
brought one long forefinger down. 
He picked up the theme from her 
voice. He closed his eyes. The 
guitar, of all instruments the most 
intimately expressive, given a 
magic sostenuto by its electronic 
graft, began to speak. 

The theme, the tree growing, 
the tree grown. 

Suddenly, the fountain, too. 
What happened then left them 
both breathless. Music of this 
nature should never be heard in 
a cubic volume smaller than its 
subject. 

When the pressured stridency 
of the music was quite gone, 
Chan looked at a cracked win- 
dow pane and then turned to 



watch a talc-fine trickle of plaster 
dust stream down from the lintel 
of the french window. 

“Where,” he said, shaken, “did 
you get that little jangle?” 

“Thin air, darling,” said Dru- 
silla blithely. “All the time, ev- 
erywhere, whenever you like. 
Listen.” 

H E cocked his head. There was 
an intense silence. His left 
hand crept up to the frets and 
spattered over them. In spite of 
the fact that he had not touched 
the strings with his right hand, 
a structure of sound hung in the 
room, reinforcing itself, holding, 
holding . finally dying. 

“That it?” he asked, awed. 

She held up a thumb and fore- 
finger very close together. “About 
so much of it.” 

“How come I never heard it 
before?” 

“You weren’t ready.” 

His eyes suddenly filled with 
tears. “Damn it, Drusilla . 
you’re — you’ve done . Oh, hell, 
I don’t know, I love you so 
much.” 

She touched his face. “Shh. 
Play for me, Chan.” 

He breathed hard, thickly. 
“Not in here.” 

He put down his guitar and 
went to get the portable ampli- 
fier. They set it upon the rolling 
lawn and plugged in the guitar. 
Chan held the instrument for a 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



silent moment, sliding his hand 
over its polished flank. He looked 
up suddenly and met Drusilla’s 
eyes. Chan’s face twisted, for her 
ecstasy and gaiety and triumph 
added up to something very like 
despair, and he did not under- 
stand. 

He would have thrown down 
the guitar then, for his heart was 
full of her, but she backed away, 
shaking her head lightly, and bent 
to the amplifier to switch it on. 
Her fingers pulled at the rotary 
switch as she turned it, and only 
she knew the nature of the mighty 
little transmitter that began to 
warm up along with the audio. 
She moved back still further; 
she did not want to be close to 
him when it — happened. 

He watched her for a moment, 
then looked down at the guitar. 
He watched his four enchanted 
left fingers hook and hover over 
the fingerboard ; he looked at 
them with a vast puzzlement that 
slowly turned to raptness. He 
began to sway gently. 

Drusilla stood tall and taut, 
looking past him to the trees, to 
the scudding clouds and beyond. 
She dropped her shields and let 
the music pour in. And from the 
guitar came a note, another, two 
together, a strange chord. For this 
I shall be killed, she thought. To 
bring to the mighty scorn her 
people had of Earth and all 
things Earthly, this molded sav- 



age who could commune like a 
Citizen . this was the greatest 
affront. 

A foam of music fell and 
feathered and rushed inward to 
the Fountainhead Itself, and ev- 
ery voice of it smashed and 
hurtled upward. The paired sixth 
strings of the guitar flung up with 
them in a bullroar glissando that 
broke and spread glistening all 
over the keyboard, falling and 
falling away from a brittle high 
spatter of doubled first strings 
struck just barely below the 
bridge, metallic and necdly; and 
if those taut strings were tied to 
a listener’s teeth, they could not 
be more intimate and shocking. 

The unique sound box found 
itself in sudden shrill resonance, 
and it woke the dark strings, the 
deep and mighty ones. They 
thrummed and sang without be- 
ing touched; and Chan’s inhu- 
man fingers found a figure in the 
middle register, folded it in on 
itself, broke it in two, and the 
broken pieces danced . and 
still the untouched strings hum- 
med and droned, first one loud 
and then another as the reson- 
ances altered and responded. 

And all at once the air was 
filled with the sharp and dusty 
smell of ozone. 

W ITH it all, the music, hers 
and Chan’s, settled itself 
down and down like some dark 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



149 



giant, pressing and sweeping and 
gathering in its drapes and folds 
as it descended to rest, to collect 
its roaring and crooning and tit- 
tering belongings all together 
that they may be pieced and 
piled and understood; until at 
last the monster was settled and 
neat, leaving a looming bulk of 
silence and an undertone of 
pumping life and multi-level 
quiet stripes of contemplation. 
The whole structure breathed, 
slowly and more slowly, held its 
breath, let a tension develop, ris- 
ing, painful, agonizing, intoler- 
able . 

“Play Red River Valley, hey, 
Chan?” 

Drusilla gasped, and the ozone 
rasped her throat. Chan’s fingers 
faltered, stopped. He half-turned, 
with a small, interrogative whim- 
per. 

Standing on the other side of 
the far hedge, near her house, was 
Luellen Mullings, her doll-figure 
foiled like a glass diamond in a 
negligible playsuit, her golden 
hair free, her perfect jaw busy on 
her sticky cud. 

There was born in Drusilla a 
fury more feral, more concentrat- 
ed, than any power of muscle or 
mind she had ever conceived of. 
Luellen Mullings, essence of all 
the degradation Earth was known 
for, all the cheapness, shallow- 
ness, ignorance and stupidity. She 
was the belch in the cathedral; 




150 




DRUSILLA STRANGE 



151 



she would befoul the Fountain 
Itself. 

“Hi, Dru, honey. Didn’t see 
you. Hey, I saw a feller at the 
Palace could play guitar holding 
it behind his back.” She sniffed. 
“What’s that funny smell? Like 
lightning or something.” 

“Get back in your house, you 
cheap little slut,” Drusilla hissed. 

“Hey, who you calling — ” Luel- 
len dipped down and picked up a 
smooth white stone twice the 
size of her fist. She raised it. Even 
Drusilla’s advanced reflexes were 
not fast enough to anticipate what 
she did. The stone left her hand 
like a bullet. Drusilla braced her- 
self — but the stone did not come 
to her. It struck Chan just be- 
hind the ear. He pivoted on his 
heel three-quarters of a revolu- 
tion, and quietly collapsed on the 
grass, the guitar nestling down 
against him like a loving cat. 

“Now look at what you made 
me do!” Luellen cried shrilly. 

Drusilla uttered a harpy’s 
scream and bounded across the 
lawn, her long hands spread out 
like talons. Luellen watched her 
come, round-eyed. 

There is a force in steady eyes 
by which a tiger may be made to 
turn away. It can make a strong 
man turn and run. There is a 
way to gather this force into a 
deadly nubbin and hurl it like a 
grenade. Drusilla knew how to 
do this, for she had done it be- 



fore; she had killed with it. But 
the force she hurled at Luellen 
Mullings now was ten times what 
she had dealt the Preceptor. 

17'OR a moment, the Universe 
went black, and then Drusilla 
became aware of a pressure on 
her face. There was another sen- 
sation, systemic, pervasive. Her 
legs, her arms, were weighted and 
tingly, and she seemed to have no 
torso at all. 

She gradually understood the 
sensation on her face. Moist 
earth and grass. She was lying 
on her stomach on the lawn. She 
absorbed this knowledge as if it 
were a complicated matrix of 
ideas which, if comprehended, 
might lead to hitherto unheard-of 
information. At last she realized 
what was wrong with her body. 
Oxygen starvation. She began to 
breathe again, hard, painful 
gasps, inflations that threatened 
to burst the pulmonary capil- 
laries, exhalations that brought 
her diaphragm upward until it 
crushed in panic against the 
pounding cardium. 

She moved feebly, pulled a 
limp hand toward her, rested a 
moment with it flat on the grass 
near her shoulder. She began to 
press herself upward weakly, fail- 
ed, rested a moment, and tried 
again. At last she raised herself 
to a sitting position. 

Chan lay where he had fallen, 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



still as death, guitar nearby. 

Pop! 

Drusilla looked up. Over the 
hedge, like an artificial flower, 
nodded Luellen’s bright head. 
The quick deft tongue was re- 
trieving the detritus of a broken 
bubble. 

Drusilla snarled and formed 
another bolt, and as it left her 
something like a huge soft mallet 
seemed to descend on her shoul- 
der-blades. Seated as she was, it 
folded her down until her chest 
struck the ground. Her hip joints 
crackled noisily. She writhed, 
straightened out, lay on her side 
gasping. 

Pop! 

Drusilla did not look up. 

Presently she heard Luellen’s 
light footsteps retreating down 
the gravel path. She gave herself 
over to a wave of weakness, and 
relaxed completely to let the 
strength flow back. 

Shh . shh . approaching 
footsteps. 

Drusilla rolled over and sat up 
again. Her head felt simultane- 
ously pressured and fragile, as if 
any sudden move would make it 
burst like a faulty boiler. She 
turned pain-blinded eyes to the 
footsteps. When the jagged ache 
receded, she saw Luellen saunter- 
ing toward her on this side of the 
hedge, swinging her hips, hum- 
ming tunelessly. 

“Feeling better, honey?” 

DRUSILLA STRANGE 



Drusilla glared at her. The 
killer-bolt began to form again. 
Luellen sank gracefully to the 
grass, near but not too near, and 
chose a grass-stem to pull up. 

“I wouldn’t if I were you, hon,” 
she said pleasantly. “I can keep 
this up all day. You’re just knock- 
ing yourself out.” 

She regarded the grass stem 
thoughtfully from her wide va- 
cant eyes, poked out a membrane 
of gum, hesitated a moment, and 
drew it back in without blowing 
a bubble. The gum clicked wetly 
twice as she worked it. 

“Damn you,” said Drusilla de- 
voutly. 

T UELLEN giggled. Drusilla 
struggled upward, leaned 
heavily on one arm, and glared. 
Luellen said, without looking at 
her, “That’s far enough, sweetie.” 
“Who are you?” Drusilla whis- 
pered. 

“Home makuh,” said Luellen, 
with a trace of Bronx accent. 
“Leisure class type home makuh.” 
“You know what I mean,” Dru- 
silla growled. 

“Whyn’t you look and see?” 
Drusilla curled her lip. 

“Don’t want to get your pretty 
probes dirty, huh? Know what 
you are? You’re a snob.” 

“A — a what?” 

“Snob,” said Luellen. She 
stretched prettily. “Just too good 
for anybody. Too good for him.” 

153 



She pointed to Chan with a ges- 
ture of her head. “Or me.” She 
shrugged. “Anybody.” 

Drusilla glanced at Chan and 
probed anxiously. 

"He’s all right,” said Luellen. 
"Just unplugged.” 

Drusilla swung her attention 
back to the other girl. Reluctant- 
ly she dropped her automatic 
shield and reached out with her 
mind. What are you? 

Luellen put her hands out, 
palms forward. "Not that way. I 
don’t do that any more. Look if 
you want to, but if you want to 
talk to me, talk out loud.” 

Drusilla probed. “A criminal!” 
she said finally, in profound dis- 
gust. 

“Sisters under the skin,” said 
Luellen. She popped her gum. 
Drusilla shuddered. Luellen said, 
“Tell you what I did.” 

“I’m not interested.” 

"Tell you, anyway. Listen,” 
Luellen said suddenly, “you 
know if you try to do anything 
to me, you’ll go flat on your 
bustle. Well, the same thing ap- 
plies if you don’t listen to me. 
Hear?” 

Drusilla dropped her eyes and 
was furiously silent. Reluctantly 
she realized that this creature 
could do exactly as she said. 

“I’m not asking you to like it,” 
Luellen said more gently. “Just 
listen, that’s all.” 

She waited a moment, and 



when Drusilla offered nothing, 
she said, “What I did, I climbed 
over the wall at school.” 

Drusilla gasped. "You went 
outside?” 

Luellen rolled over onto her 
stomach and propped herself on 
her elbows. She pulled another 
blade of grass and broke it. 
"Something funny happened to 
me. You know the feeling-picture 
about jumping?” 

Drusilla recognized it instant- 
ly, the sweet, strong, breathless 
sensation of being strong and 
leaping from soft grass, floating, 
landing lithely. 

“You do,” said Luellen, glanc- 
ing at Drusilla’s face. “Well, I 
was having that picture one fine 
morning when it — stuck. I mean 
like one of the phonograph rec- 
ords here when it gets stuck. 
There I was feeling a jump. Just 
off the ground, and it all froze.” 

S HE laughed a little. “I was 
real scared. After a while, it 
started again. I went and asked 
my tutor about it. She got all 
upset and went to the Preceptor. 
He called me in and there was no 
end of hassel about it.” Again she 
laughed. “I’d have forgotten the 
whole thing if he hadn’t made 
such a fuss. He wanted me to for- 
get it in the worsf way. Tried to 
make me think it happened be- 
cause there was something wrong 
with me.

"So I got to thinking about it. 
When you do that, you start look- 
ing pretty carefully at all the 
pictures. And you know, they’re 
full of scratches and flaws, if 
you look. 

"But all the time they were 
teaching us that this was the 
world over the Wall — perfect 
green grass, beautiful men, the 
fountain and the falls and all the 
rest of it, that we were supposed 
to graduate to when the time 
came. I wondered so much that 
I wouldn’t wait any more. So I 
went over the wall. They caught 
me and sent me here.” 

"I don’t wonder,’’ said Drusilla 
primly. 

Luellen put pink fingers to her 
lips, hauled the gum out almost 
to arm’s length, and chewed it 
back in as she talked. "And all 
you did was knock off the Pre- 
ceptor!” 

Drusilla winced and said noth- 
ing. 

Luellen said, "You been here 
about two years, right? How 
many of us prisoners have you 
run into?” 

“None!” said Drusilla, with 
something like indignation. "I 
wouldn’t have anything to do 
with — ” She clamped her lips 
tight and snorted through her 
nostrils. "Will you stop that gig- 
gling?” 

"I can’t help it,” said Luellen. 
“It’s part of the pattern for home 



makuhs. All home makuhs gig- 
gle.” 

“. And that voice!” 

"That’s part of the pattern too, 
hon,” said Luellen. “How do you 
think I’d go over at the canasta 
table if I weren’t a-flutter and a- 
twitter, all coos and sighs and 
gentle breathings? My God, the 
girls’d be scared right out of their 
home permanents!” She tittered 
violently. 

“Again!” Drusilla winced. 
“You might as well get used to 
it, hon. I had to. You’ll be doing 
something equally atrocious your- 
self, pretty soon. It goes under 
the head of camouflage . Look, 
I’ll stop fooling around. There's 
a couple of hard truths you have 
to get next to. I know what you 
did. You set up a reflex to blank 
out any ex-Citizen you might 
meet. Right?” 

"One must keep oneself de- 
cent,” insisted Drusilla. 

T UELLEN shook her head 
wonderingly. "You’re just 
dumb, girl. I don’t like you, but 
I have to be sorry for you.” 

"I don’t need your pity!” 
“Yes, you do. You’ve been 
asleep for a whole lot of years 
and you just have to snap out of 
it.” Luellen knelt and sat back 
on her heels. "Tell me — up to 
the time they shipped you here, 
where did you go?” 

“You know perfectly well. The 



DRUSILLA STRANGE

Great Hall. My garden. My dor- 
mitory. That’s all.” 

“Um-hmm. That’s all. And ev- 
ery minute since you were born, 
you’ve been conditioned: a Citi- 
zen is the finest flower of creation. 
Be a good obedient girl and you’ll 
gambol on the green for the rest 
of your life. Meanwhile there are 
criminals who get sent to prison, 
and the prison is the lowest cess- 
pool in the Universe where you 
live out your life being reminded 
of the glory of the world you 
lost.” 

“Of course, but you make it 
sound — ” 

“Did you ever see any of those 
big muscular beautiful men the 
pictures told you about? Did you 
ever see that old-granite and new- 
grass landscape, or get warm 
under that nice big sun?” 

“No, I was sent here before I 
had — ” 

Luellen demonstrated her ties 
to Earth by uttering a syllable 
which was, above all else, Earthy. 
“You’re the dumbest blind kitten 
I ever saw. And tell me, when 
they took you to the ship, did 
you get a chance to look around?” 
“I wasn’t . worthy,” said 
Drusilla miserably. “If a — a 
criminal was privileged to see 
outside the Wall — ” 

“They blindfolded you. Yes, 
and you never got a chance to 
look out of the ship when it left, 
either. Look, Citizen,” she said 



scornfully, “if you hadn’t had 
the good sense to get yourself sent 
here, you never would have got- 
ten over the Wall!” 

“I had only six more years be- 
fore I — ” 

“Before you’d be quietly moved 
to another Walled Place with 
your age group. And maybe 
you’d have been bred, and may- 
be not, and by the time you re- 
alized there was no release for 
you, you’d be so old you wouldn’t 
care any more. And they call that 
a world and this a prison!” 

Drusilla suddenly put her 
hands over her ears. “I won’t 
listen to this! I won’t!” 

Luellen grasped her wrist in a 
remarkably powerful little hand. 
“Yes, by God, you will,” she 
said between her perfect teeth. 
“Our race is old and dying, rot- 
ten to the core. Know why you 
never saw any men? Because 
there are only a few hundred of 
them left. They lie in their cubi- 
cles and get fat and breed. And 
most of their children are girls, 
because that’s the way it was ar- 
ranged so long ago that we’ve 
forgotten how it was done or how 
to change it. You know what’s 
over the Wall? Nothing! It’s an 
ice-world, with a dying sun and 
thinning air, and a little cluster 
of Walled Places to breed women 
for the men to breed with, and a 
few old, old, worn transmitters 
for music and pictures to condi-

tion the blindworms who live and 
die there!” 

1~\RUSILLA began to cry. Lu- 
ellen sat back and watched 
her, a great softness coming into 
her eyes. 

“Cry, that’s good, sweetie,” she 
said huskily. “Ah, you poor brat. 
You could’ve gotten straightened 
out the day you arrived. But no. 
Criminals were the lowest of the 
low, and you wouldn’t associate 
with them. Earth and humans 
were insects and savages, because 
that’s what you were taught. To 
be a Citizen was to be a god 
among gods, and to hear the 
music was your torture, for what 
you’d lost.” 

“What about the torture?” 

“Transmitters in th^ guardian 
ships. You know about that.” 

“But the Citizens on board 
them — ” 

“What? Oh, for Pete’s sake, 
hon! They’re machines, that’s 
all.” 

“They’re not! The killer-boats 
are — ” 

“The killer-boats home on any 
human mind that begins to oper- 
ate near the music bands. You 
had a close call, kitten.” 

“I wish one had come,” Dru- 
silla said miserably. “That’s what 
I wanted.” 

“One did come, silly. But I 
don’t get you. What did you 
want?” 



“I wanted it to kill me. That’s 
why I taught Chan to — ” 

Luellen clapped her hands to 
her face. “I thought that, but I 
couldn’t really believe it! Sweetie, 
I got news for you. That boat 
wouldn’t have killed you. It was 
after your boy-friend there.” 
Drusilla’s face went almost as 
white as her teeth. She put her 
fist to her mouth and bit it, her 
eyes round, full of horror. 

“It’s all right,” Luellen mur- 
mured. “It’s gone. It was homing 
on him, and when he stopped ra- 
diating, it stopped coming. It’s 
just a machine.” 

“You stopped it,” Drusilla 
breathed. Slowly she sat up 
straight, staring at the little 
blonde as if she had never seen 
her before. 

“Pity if one of us couldn’t out- 
think a machine,” said Luellen 
deprecatingly. Then, “What is it, 
Dru? What’s the matter?” 

“He might have been . 
killed.” 

“You only just thought of that. 
Really thought of it.” 

Drusilla nodded. 

“I’ll bet this is the first time 
you ever thought of someone 
else. See what snobbery can do?” 
“I feel awful.” 

T UELLEN laughed at her. 

“You feel fine. Or you will. 
What you’ve got is an attack of 
something called humility. It

rushes in to fill the hole when the 
snobbery is snatched out. You’ll 
be all right now.” 

‘‘Will I?” She licked her lips. 
She tried to speak and could not. 
She pointed a wavering finger at 
the unconscious man. 

“Him?” Luellen answered the 
unspoken question. “Just you 
keep him asleep for a while. Give 
him more music, but keep him 
away from that.” She pointed to 
the sky. “He won’t know the dif- 
ference.” 

“Humility,” said Drusilla, 
thoughtfully. “That’s when you 
feel . not good enough. Is that 
it?” 

“Something like that.” 

“Then I don’t ... I don’t think 
I understand. Lu, do you know 
why I killed the Preceptor?” 
Luellen shook her head. “It 
was a good idea, whatever.” 
Drusilla said with difficulty, 
“My group went to be chosen for 
breeding. There’s a — custom that 
the . ugliest girl must be sent 
back to her garden. H-he pointed 
me out. I was the ugliest one 
there. He said I was the ugliest 
woman in the world. I went . 
kind of . crazy, I guess. I 
killed him.” 

Suddenly she was in Luellen’s 
strong small arms. “Oh, for God’s 
sake,” said Luellen with a rough- 
ness that made Drusilla cry 
again. “You’re the sorriest most 
mixed-up little chicken ever. 



Don’t you know that a perfect 
necklace has to have an ugliest 
diamond in it somewhere?” She 
thumped Drusilla’s heaving 
shoulder. “We’ve been bred for 
beauty for more generations than 
this Earth has years, Dru. On 
Earth you’re one of the most 
beautiful women alive.” 

“He told me that once, and I 
could have . killed him,” Dru- 
silla squeaked. She swallowed 
hard, moved back to peer pit- 
eously into Luellen’s face. “Is 
that humility? To feel you’re not 
good enough?” 

“That’s humiliation,” said Lu- 
ellen. She paused thoughtfully. 
“And here’s the difference: Hu- 
mility is knowing something is 
finer and better than you can ever 
be, so it’$ worth putting every- 
thing you have behind that some- 
thing. Everything! Like . 

She laughed. “Like me and 
that ham novelist of mine. Bit by 
bit, year by year, he gets better. 
I give him exactly what he needs, 
in his own time. Right now what 
he wants is an irresponsible little 
piece of candy he can pick up or 
put down, and meantime get en- 
vied all over the neighborhood 
for. He’s got it in him to do some 
really important work some day, 
and when he does he’ll need 
something else from me, and I’ll 
be here to give it to him. If, fifty 
years from now, he comes dod- 
dering up to me and tells me I’ve 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



grown with him through the 
years, I’ll know I did the thing 
right.” 

Drusilla worried at the state- 
ment, turning it over, shaking it. 
She parted her lips, closed them 
again. 

Luellen said, “Go ahead. Ask 
me.” 

T\RUSILLA looked to her tim- 
idly, dropped her eyes. “Is 
he really finer and better?” 

“Snob!” said Luellen, and this 
time it was all kindliness. “Of 
course! He’s an Earthman, Dru. 
Earth is young and crude and 
raw, but it’s strong and it’s good. 
Do you call an infant stupid be- 
cause it can’t talk, or is a child 
bad because it hasn’t learned 
reason? We have nothing but de- 
cadence to bring to Earth. So in- 
stead we help Earth with the best 
it has. You keep your eyes open 
from now on. Dru. Nine women 
out of ten who truly help their 
men to realize themselves are 



what you’ve been calling crim- 
inals. 

“You’ll find them all over, up 
and down th6 social scale, through 
and through the history of this 
culture. Put up your shields 
again — for fun — and watch the 
women you meet. See how some 
seem to understand one another 
on sight — how they pass a glance 
that seems to be full of secrets. 
They’re the hope of the world, 
Dru darling, and this world is 
the hope of the Galaxy." She fol- 
lowed Drusilla’s gaze and smiled. 
“Now that you come to think of 
it, you love him, don’t you?” 

“Now that I come to think of 
it . .” 

She raised her head and looked 
at the sky. Gradually a smile was 
born on her trembling lips. She 
shook herself and took a deep 
breath of the warm evening air. 

“Listen,” she said. She laughed 
unevenly. It is sort of scratchy, 
isn’t it?”
