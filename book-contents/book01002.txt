FOR WRITERS MOSTLY 



TJECAUSE of the lavishly at- 
tractive novel contest being 
sponsored jointly by GALAXY 
and Simon & Schuster, the big- 
gest in the history of science 
fiction, it’s inevitable that authors 
who are unfamiliar with this field 
will be studying the magazine to 
learn what kind of material we 
are seeking. 

To save their time and ours, 
here is a partial list of over- 
worked ideas that should be 
strenuously avoided: 

Fictional warnings of nuclear 
and biological destruction, the 
post-atomic -world, reversion to 
barbarism, mutant children slain 
because they have only ten toes 
and fingers instead of twelve, ab- 
surdly planned and preposterous- 
ly successful revolts against 
dictatorships, problems of survi- 
val wearily turned over to wo- 
men, war between groups, 
nations, worlds and solar systems. 

Flying Saucers, cops and rob- 
bers or cowboys and Indians in 
space, the duel between the good 
guy and the bad guy alone on an 
asteroid, the bright revelation 
that the characters we have been 
reading about are Adam and Eve 
or Jesus, the creation 'of a minia- 
ture universe in a laboratory by a 
scientist whose name turns out 
to be an anagram of Jehovah, the 



alien eater of life force in the 
Andes whose menu consists ex- 
clusively of pretty virgins. 

There are many more that 
slither across my desk, to lie 
there pulsing feebly while they 
acquire rejection slips, but the 
debilitated notions listed are 
readiest to mind. 

From time to time, writers can 
still make them come to life 
through rarely encountered vir- 
tuosity. The odds on that hap- 
pening are not worth taking, 
however. The best advice to fol- 
low is to learn how to hunt down 
fresh themes or new approaches 
to old ones. What’s done with the 
idea is then a matter of talent and 
skill, neither of which can be 
taught here, but the basic steps 
in science fiction thinking can 
be presented. 

First of all, science fiction an- 
swers in dramatic terms the un- 
stated question: “What would 
happen if-—?” 

The if selected depends on 
whether the author takes the 
most blatant trends or tendencies 
in our society, in which case he 
is competing with just about ev- 
erybody else, or digs beneath the 
surface for less apparent ones. 
Those, obviously, rate and receive 
the more enthusiastic welcome. 

Political conflicts and wars,

however gigantic, have a way of 
becoming obscured by time. But 
the inventions and discoveries 
that were being made then live 
long after the issues are resolved. 

Kaiser Wilhelm, for example, 
quickly turned into a pathetic 
figure after his defeat; the de- 
velopment of planes, tanks, long- 
range artillery and submarines 
was the lasting influence of World 
War I. Even Hitler has lost much 
of his frightfulness, while jets, 
rockets, atomic energy and anti- 
biotics, all of which got their 
start in World War II, will be 
part of the life of the future. 

What will be remembered when 
the threat of communism is gone? 
That’s what the writer has to find 
and dramatize for us. 

OPACE travel is perhaps the 
^ most popular subject in sci- 
ence fiction and writers have 
suggested all kinds of crews: in- 
troverts because they can take 
loneliness, extroverts because they 
get along better with each other, 
women because they tolerate 
monotony, men because they are 
more adventurous. The reasoning 
is generally sound enough, but 
aren’t there other possibilities? 

Gravy Planet offered a midget 
spaceman, 60 pounds of computer 
and pilot, an enormous saving of 
fuel, food, air renewal and living 
space. 

Why not deaf mutes? The noise 

FOR WRITERS MOSTLY 



of takeoff and landing wouldn’t 
bother them, and they’ve been 
conditioned to the awful silence 
of the void. The blind, on the 
other hand, wouldn’t be appalled 
by the immensities of space. 

Missionaries have always been 
on the heels of explorers, yet 
what would happen if they came 
across a humanoid race — not the 
usual monstrosities — on a planet 
where personal death is un- 
known? There are savages on 
Earth who don’t have this knowl- 
edge, but they soon pick it up, 
and fear along with it. Suppose, 
though, that the alien bodies 
disintegrate instantly at death? 
The concept of afterlife would be 
completely unthinkable to them. 

The canals of Mars irrigate 
the deserts? Not necessarily. 
Maybe they’re meant to drain the 
land and keep it suitably arid tor 
Martians. 

Well, there’s the method of 
finding fresh ideas — turn the ob- 
vious upside down, inside out and 
hind-end fore. 

Actually, digging up ideas is 
only the beginning of the job. 
Next comes choosing characters, 
building conflict, sustaining sus- 
pense, advancing the story, work- 
ing out a solution consistent with 
theme and characterization — all 
the labor of orchestration. 

It’s hard, lonesome work, but 
who said writing is easy?

THE OLD 

DIE RICH 

By H. L. GOLD 

It is the kind of news item you read at least a dozen times a 
year, wonder about briefly , and then promptly forget— but the 
real story is the one that the reporters are unable to cover.' 



tering bureau, dim bulb hanging 
from the ceiling, the flaking metal 
bed. 

There was a woman on the bed, 
an old woman with white hair 
thin enough to show the tight - 
drawn scalp, her face and body 
so emaciated that the flesh be- 
tween the bones formed parch- 
ment pockets. The M.E. was 
going over her as if she were a 
side of beef that he had to put a 



“Y; 



OU again, Weldon,” 
the Medical Examiner 
said wearily. 

I nodded pleasantly and looked 
around the shabby room with a 
feeling of hopeful eagerness. 
Maybe this time, I thought, I’d 
get the answer. I had the same 
sensation I always had in these 
places — the quavery senile de- 
spair at being closed in a room 
with the single shaky chair, tot-

federal grade stamp on, grum- 
bling meanwhile about me and 
Sergeant Lou Pape, who had 
brought me here. 

“When are you going to stop 
taking Weldon around to these 
cases, Sergeant?” the M.G. de- 
manded in annoyance. “Damned 
actor and his morbid curiosity!” 
For the first time, Lou was 
stung into defending me. “Mr. 
Weldon is a friend of mine — I 
used to be an actor, too, before 
I joined the force — and he’s a 
follower of Stanislavsky.” 

The beat cop who’d reported 
the D.O.A. whipped around at 
the door. “A Red?” 

T LET Lou Pape explain what 
the Stanislavsky method of 
acting was, while I sat down on 
the one chair and tried to apply 
it. Stanislavsky was the great 
pre-Revolution Russian stage di- 
rector whose idea was that actors 
had to think and feel like the 
characters they portrayed so they 
could be them. A Stanislavskian 
works out everything about a 
character right up to the point 
where a play starts — where he 
was born, when, his relationship 
with his parents, education, child- 
hood, adolescence, maturity, at- 
titudes toward men, women, sex, 
money, success, including inci- 
dents. The play itself is just an 
extension of the life history cre- 
ated by the actor. 



How does that tie in with the 
old woman who had died? Well, 
I’d had the cockeyed kind of 
luck to go bald at 25 and I’d been 
playing old men ever since. I had 
them down pretty well — it’s not 
just a matter of shuffling around 
all hunched over and talking in 
a high cracked voice, which is 
cornball acting, but learning what 
old people are like inside — and 
these cases I talked Lou Pape 
into taking me on were studies in 
senility. I wanted to understand 
them, know what made them do 
what they did, fee! the compul- 
sion that drove them to it. 

The old woman on the bed, for 
instance, had $32,000 in five bank 
accounts . and she’d died of 
starvation. 

You’ve come across' such cases 
in the news, at least a dozen a 
year, and wondered who they 
were and why they did it. But 
you read the items, thought 
about them for a little while, and 
then forgot them. My interest 
was professional; I made my liv- 
ing playing old people and I had 
to know as much about them as 
I could. 

That’s how it started off, at 
any rate. But the more cases I 
investigated, the less sense they 
made to me, until finally they 
were practically an obsession. 

Look, they almost always have 
around $30,000 pinned to their 
underwear, hidden in mattresses,

I parked in the bank, yet they 
turve themselves to death. If I 
■ t>uld understand them, I could 
write a play or have one written; 
i might really make a name for 
myself, even get a Hollywood 
> ontract, maybe, if I could act 
them as they should be acted. 

So I sat there in the lone chair, 
t tying to reconstruct the charac- 
ter of the old woman who had 
died rather than spend a single 
rent of her $32,000 for food. 

MALNUTRITION induced 
by senile psychosis,” the 
M.E. said, writing out the death 
certificate. He turned to me. 
“There’s no mystery to it, Wel- 
don. They starve because they’re 
less afraid of death than digging 
into their savings.” 

I’d been imagining myself 
growing weak from hunger and 
trying to decide that I ought to 
eat even if it cost me something. 
I camd out of it and said, “That’s 
what you keep telling me." 

“I keep hoping it’ll convince 
you so you won’t come around 
any more. What are the chances, 
Weldon?”. 

“Depends. I will when I’m sure 
you’re right. I’m not.” 

He shrugged disgustedly, or- 
dered the wicker basket from the 
meat wagon and had the old wo- 
man carried out. He and the beat 
cop left with the basket team. 
He could at least have said good- 



by. He never did, though. 

A fat lot I cared about his 
attitude or dogmatic medical 
opinion. Getting inside this char- 
acter was more important. The 
setting should have helped; it 
was depressing, rank with the feel 
of solitary desperation and need- 
less death. 

Lou Pape stood looking out 
the one dirty window, waiting 
patiently for me. I let my joints 
stiffen as if they were thirty years 
older and more worn out than 
they were, and empathized my- 
self into a dilemma between get- 
ting still weaker from hunger and 
drawing a little money out of 
the bank. 

I worked at it for half an hour 
or so with the deep concentration 
you acquire when you use the 
Stanislavsky method. Then I 
gave up. 

“The M.E. is wrong, Lou,” I 
said. “It doesn’t feel right.” 

Lou turned around from the 
window. He’d stood there all that 
time without once coughing or 
scratching or doing anything else 
that might have distracted me. 
“He knows his business, Mark.” 

“But he doesn’t know old peo- 
ple.” 

“What is it you don’t get?” he 
prompted, helping me dig my 
way through a characterization 
like the trained Stanislavskian he 
was — and still would have been 
if he hadn’t gotten so sick of the 



THE OLD DIE RICH 



7 




insecurity of acting that he’d be- 
come a cop. “Can’t money be 
more important to a psychotic 
than eating?” 

. "Sure,” I agreed. “Up to a 
point. Undereating, yes. Actual 
starvation, no.” 

“Why not?” 

“You and the M.E. think it’s 
easy to starve to death. It isn’t: 
Not when you can buy day-old 
bread at the bakeries, soup bones 
for about a nickel a pound, wilt- 
ed vegetables that groceries are 
glad to get rid of. Anybody who’s 
willing to eat that stuff can stay 
alive on nearly nothing a day. 
Nearly nothing, Lou, and hunger 
is a damned potent instinct. I 
can understand hating to spend 
even those few cents. I can’t see 
going without food altogether.” 

TTE took out a cigarette ; he 
hadn’t until then because he 
didn’t want to interrupt my con- 
centration. “Maybe they get too 
weak to go out after old bread 
and meat bones and wilted vege- 
tables.”,, 

“It still doesn’t figure.” I got 
up off the shaky chair, my joints 
now really stiff from sitting in it. 
“Do you know how long it takes 
to die of starvation?” 

“That depends on age, health, 
amount of activity — »” 

“Nuts!” I said. “It would take 
weeks!” 

“So it takes weeks. Where’s the 



problem — if there is one?” 

I lit the pipe I’d learned to 
smoke instead of cigarettes — old 
men seem to use pipes more than 
anything else, though maybe it’ll 
be different in the next genera- 
tion. More cigarette smokers now, 
you see, and they’d stick to the 
habit unless the doctor ordered 
them to cut it out. 

“Did you ever try starving for 
weeks, Lou?” I asked. 

“No. Did you?” 

“In a way. All these cases 
you’ve been taking me on for the 
last couple of years — I’ve tried to 
be them. But let's say it’s pos- 
sible to die of starvation when 
you have thousands of dollars 
put away. Let’s say you don’t 
think of scrounging off food 
stores or working out a jvay of 
freeloading or hitting soup lines. 
Let’s say you stay in your room 
and slowly starve to death.” 

He slowly picked a fleck of 
tobacco off his lip and flitked it 
away, his sharp black eyes pok- 
ing holes in the situation I’d 
built up for him. But he wasn’t 
ready to say anything yet. 

“There’s charity,” I. went on, 
“relief — except for those who 
have their dough in banks, where 
it can be checked on — old age 
pension, panhandling, cadging off 
neighbors.” 

He said, “We know these cases 
are hermits. They don’t make 
contact with anybody.”

"Even when they’re starting to 
t real hungry?” 

"You’ve got something, Mark, 
-ul that’s the wrong tack,” he 
n<l thoughtfully. “The point is 
Imt they don’t have to make 
"iitact; other people know them 
-i about them. Somebody would 
heck after a few days or a week 
the janitor, the landlord, some- 
ne in the house or the neighbor- 
hood.” 

"So they’d be found before they 
died.” 

"You’d think so, wouldn’t 
you?” he agreed reluctantly. 
"They don’t generally have 
friends, and the relatives are usu- 
ally so distant, they hardly know 
these old people and whether 
they’re alive or not. Maybe that’s 
what threw us off. But you don’t 
need friends and relatives to start 
wondering, and investigate when 
you haven’t shown up for a 
while.” He lifted his head and 
looked at me. “What does that 
prove, Mark?” 

“That there’s something wrong 
with these cases. I want to find 
out what.” 

1 GOT Lou to take me down 
to Headquarters, where he let 
me see the bankbooks the old 
woman had left. 

“She took damned good care 
of them,” I said. “They look al- 
most new,” 

“Wouldn’t you take damned 



good care of the most important 
thing in the world to you?” he 
asked. “You’ve seen the hoards 
of money the others leave. Same 
thing.” 

.1 peered closely at the earliest 
entry, April 23, 1907, $150. My 
eyes aren’t that bad; I was peer- 
ing at the ink. It was dark, un- 
faded. I pointed it out to Lou. 

“From not being exposed to 
daylight much,” he said. “They 
don’t haul out the bankbooks or 
money very often, I guess.” 

“And that adds up for you? 
I can see them being psychotics 
all their lives . but not senile 
psychotics.” 

“They hoarded, Mark. That 
adds up for me.” 

“Funny,” I said, watching him 
maneuver his cigarette as if he 
loved the feel of it, drawing the 
smoke down and letting it out in 
plumes of different shapes, from 
rings to slender streams. What a 
living he could make doing cigar- 
ette commercials on TV! “I can 
see you turn into one of these 
cases, Lou.” 

He looked startled for a sec- 
ond, but then crushed out the 
butt carefully so he could watch 
it instead of me. “Yeah? How 
so?” 

“You’ve been too scared by 
poverty to take a chance. You 
know you could do all right act- 
ing, but you don’t dare giving up 
this crummy job. Carry that far

enough and . you try to stop 
spending money, then cut out 
eating, and finally wind up dead 
of starvation in a cheap room.” 
“Me? I’d never get that scared 
of being broke!” 

“At the age of 70 or 80?” 
“Especially then! I’d probably 
tear loose for a while and then 
buy into a home for the aged." 

I wanted to grin, but I didn’t. 
He’d proved my point. He’d also 
shown that he was as bothered 
by these old people as I was. 

“Tell me, Lou. If somebody 
kept you from dying, would you 
give’ him any dough for it, even 
if you were a senile psychotic?” 
I could see him using the Stan- 
islavsky method to feel his way 
to the answer. He shook his 
head. “Not while I was alive. 
Will it, maybe, not give it.” 
“How would that be as a mo- 
tive?” 

H E leaned against a metal fil- 
ing cabinet. “No good, Mark, 
You know what a hell of a time 
we have tracking down relatives 
to give the money to, because 
these people don’t leave wills. 
The few relatives we find are al- 
ways surprised when they get 
their inheritance— most of them 
hardly remember dear old who- 
ever-it-was that died and left it 
to them. All the other estates 
eventually go to the State trea- 
sury, unclaimed.” 



“Well, it was an idea.” I open 
ed the oldest bankbook again. 
"Anybody ever think of testing 
the ink, Lou?” ' 

“What for? The banks’ records 
always check. These aren’t for 
geries, if that’s what you’r 
thinking.” 

"I don’t know what I’m think 
ing,” I admitted. “But I’d like 
to turn a chemist loose on this 
for a little while.” 

“Look, Mark, there’s a lot I’i 
willing to do for you, and I think 
I’ve done plenty, but there’s a 
limit—” 

I let him explain why he could- 
n’t let me borrow the book and 
then waited while he figured out 
how it could be done and did it. 
He was still grumbling when he 
helped me pick a chemist out of 
the telephone directory and went 
along to the lab with me. 

“But don’t get any wrong no- 
tions,” he said ' on the way, “I 
have to protect State property, 
that’s all, because I signed for it 
and I’m responsible.” 

“Sure, sure,” I agreed, to hu- 
mor him. “If you’re not curious, 
why not just wait outside for 
me?” 

He gave me one of those white- 
tooth grins that he had no right 
to deprive women audiences of. 
“I could do that, but I’d rather 
see you make a sap of yourself.” 
I turned the bankbook over to 
the chemist and we waited for 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the report. When it came, it had 
to be translated. 

HPHE ink was typical of those 
used 50 years ago. Lou. Pape 
gave me a jab in the ribs at 
that. But then the chemist said 
that, according to the amount of 
oxidation, it seemed fresh enough 
to be only a few months or years 
old, and it was Lou’s turn to get 
jabbed. Lou pushed him about 
the aging, asking if it couldn’t 
be the result of unusually good 
care. The chemist couldn’t say — 
that depended on the kind of 
care; an airtight compartment, 
perhaps, filled with one -of the 
inert gases, or a vacuum. They 
hadn’t been kept that way, of 
course, so Lou looked as baffled 
as I felt. 

He took the bankbook and we 
went out to the street. 

“See what I mean?” I asked 
quietly, not wanting to rub it in. 

“I see something, but I don’t 
know what. Do you?” 

“I wish I could say yes. It 
doesn’t make any more sense 
than anything else about these 
cases.” 

“What do you do next?” 
“Damned if I know. There are 
thousands of old people in the 
city. Only a few of them take 
this way out. I have to try to find 
them before they do.” 

“If they’re loaded, they won’t 
say so, Mark, and there’s no 



way ^f telling them from those 
who are down and out.” 

I rubbed my pipe disgruntled- 
ly against the side of my nose 
to oil it. “Ain’t this a beaut of a 
problem? I wish I liketk problems. 
I hate them.” 

Lou had to get back on duty. 
I had nowhere to go and nothing 
to do except worry my way 
through this tangle. He headed 
back to Headquarters and I went 
over to the park and sat in the 
sun, warming myself and trying 
to think like a senile psychotic 
who would rather die of starva- 
tion than spend a few cents for 
food. 

I didn’t get anywhere, natur- 
ally. There are too many ways of 
beating starvation, too many 
chances of being found before it’s 
too late. 

And the fresh ink, over half a 
century old , . , 

T TOOK to hanging around 
banks, hoping I’d see some- 
one come in with an old bank- 
book that had fresh ink from 
50 years before. Lou was some 
help there — he convinced the 
guards and tellers that I wasn’t 
an old-looking guy casing the 
place for a gang, and even got 
the tellers to watch out for par- 
ticularly dark ink in ancient 
bankbooks. 

I stuck at it for a month, al- 
though there were a few stage 



THE OLD DIE RICH 



11 




calls that didn’t turn out right, 
and one radio and two TV parts, 
which did and kept me going. I 
was almost glad the stage parts 
hadn’t been given to me; they’d 
have interrupted my outside 
work. 

After a month without a thing 
turning up at the banks, though, 
I went back to my two rooms in 
the theatrical hotel one night, 
tired and discouraged, and I 
found Lou there. I expected him 
to give me another talk on drop- 
ping the whole thing; he’d been 
doing that for a couple of weeks 
now, every time we got together. 
I felt too low to put up an argu- 
ment. But Lou was holding back 
his excitement — acting like a cop, 
you know, instead of projecting 
his feelings — and he couldn’t 
haul me out to his car as fast 
as he probably wanted me to go. 

“Been trying to get in touch 
with you all day, Mark. Some 
old guy was found wandering 
around, dazed and suffering from 
malnutrition, with $17,000 in 
cash inside the lining of his 
jacket.” 

"Alive?” I asked, shocked right 
into eagerness again. 

"Just barely. They’re trying 
intravenous feeding to pull him 
through, I don’t think he’ll make 
it.” 

“For God’s sake, let’s get there 
before he conks out!” 

Lou raced me to the City Hos- 

* 



pital and up to the ward. There 
was a scrawny old man in a bed, 
nothing but a papery skin 
stretched thin over a face like a 
skull and a body like a Hallow 
een skeleton, shivering as if he 
was cold. I knew it wasn’t the 
cold. The medics were injecting 
a heart stimulant into him and 
he was vibrating like a rattletrap 
car racing over a gravel road. 

“Who are you?” I practically 
yelled, grabbing his skinny arm. 
“What happened to you?” 

He went on shaking with his 
eyes closed and his mouth open. 

“Ah, hell!” I said, disgusted. 
“He’s in a coma.” 

“He might start talking,” Lou 
told me. “I fixed it up so you 
can sit here and listen in case he 
does.” 

“So I can listen to delirious 
ravings, you mean.” 

Lou got me a chair and put it 
next to the bed. “What are you 
kicking about? This is the first 
live one you’ve seen, isn’t it? 
That ought to be good enough for 
you.” He looked as annoyed as a 
director. “Besides, you can get 
biographical data out of delirium 
that you’d never get if he was 
conscious.” 

H E was right, of course. Not 
only data, but attitudes, 
wishes, resentments that would 
normally be repressed. I wasn’t 
thinking of acting at the moment,

r hough. Here was somebody who 
• trnld tell me what I wanted to 
know . only he couldn’t talk. 

Lou went to the door. “Good 
nek,” he said, and went out. 

1 sat down and stared at the 
i ild man, willing him to talk. I 
don't have to ask if you’ve ever 
lone that; everybody has. You 
krep thinking over and over, get- 
ting more and more tense, “Talk, 
damn you, talk !” until you find 
that every muscle in your body 
is a fist and your jaws are aching 
because you’ve been clenching 
your teeth so hard. You might 
just as well not bother, but once 
in a while a coincidence makes 
you think you’ve done it. Like 
now. 

The old man sort of came to. 
That is, he opened his eyes and 
looked around without seeing 
anything, or it was so far away 
and long ago that nobody else 
could see what he saw. 

I hunched forward on the 
chair and willed harder than 
ever. Nothing happened. He 
stared at the ceiling and through 
and beyond me. Then he closed 
his eyes again and I slumped 
back, defeated and bitter — but 
that was when he began talking. 

There were a couple of women, 
though they might have been lit- 
tle girls in his childhood, and 
he had his troubles with them. 
He was praying for a toy train, 
a roadster, to pass his tests, to 



keep from being fired, to be less 
lonely, and back to toys again. 
He hated his father, and his mo- 
ther was too busy with church 
bazaars "and such to pay much 
attention to him. There was a 
sister: she died when he was a 
kid. He was glad she died, hop- 
ing maybe now his mother would 
notice him ,*but he was also filled 
with guilt because he was glad. 
Then somebody, he felt, was try- 
ing to shove him out of his job. 

The intravenous feeding kept 
dripping into his vein and he 
went on rambling. After ten or 
fifteen minutes of it, he fell 
asKiep. I felt so disappointed that 
I could have slapped him awake, 
only it wouldn’t have done any 
good. Smoking would have' help- 
ed me relax, but it wasn’t al- 
lowed, and I didn’t dare go 
outside for one, for fear he might 
revive again and this time come 
up to the present. 

“TRROKE!” he suddenly shriek- 
ed, trying to sit up. 

I pushed him down gently, 
and he went on in frightful ter- 
ror, “Old and poor, nowhere to 
go, nobody wants me, can’t make 
a living, read the ads every day, 
no jobs for old men.” 

He blurted through weeks, 
months, years — I don’t know — 
of fear and despair. And finally 
he came to somefhing that made 
his face glow like a radium di£l. 



THE OLD DIE RICH 



13 




“An ad. No experience needed. 
Good salary." His face got dark 
and awful. All he added was, 
“El Greco,” or something that 
sounded like it, and then he went 
into terminal breathing. 

I rang for the nurse and she 
went for the doctor. I couldn’t 
stand the long moments when 
the old man’s chest stopped mov- 
ing, the abrupt frantic gulps of 
air followed by no breath at all. 
I wanted to get away from it, 
but I had to wait for whatever 
more he might say. 

It didn’t come. His eyes fogged 
and rolled up and he stopped 
taking those spasmodic strang- 
ling breaths. The nurse came 
back with the doctor, who felt 
his pulse and shook his head. 
She pulled the blanket over the 
old man’s face. 

I left, feeling sick. I’d learned 
things I already knew about hate 
and love and fear and hope and 
frustration. There was an ad in 
it somewhere, but I had no way 
of telling if it had been years ago 
or recently. And a name that 
sounded like “El Greco.” That 
was a Spanish painter of four- 
five hundred years ago. Had the 
old guy been remembering a pic- 
ture he’d seen? 

No, he’d come up at least close 
to the present. The ad seemed to 
solve his problem about being 
broke. But what about the $17,- 
060 that had been found in the 

14 



lining of his jacket? He hadn’t 
mentioned that. Of course, being 
a senile psychotic, he could have 
considered himself broke even 
with that amount of money. None 
coming in, you see. 

That didn’t add up, either. His 
was the terror of being old and 
jobless. If he’d had money, he 
would have figured how to make 
it last, and that would have 
come through in one way or an- 
other. 

There was the ad, there was his 
hope, and there was this El Gre- 
co. A Greek restaurant, maybe, 
where he might have been bum- 
ming his meals. 

But where did the $17,000 fit 
in? 

L OU Pape was too fed up with 
the whole thing to discuss it 
with me. He just gave me the 
weary eye and said, “You’re 
riding this too hard, Mark. The 
guy was talking from fever. How 
do I know what figures and what 
doesn’t when I’m dealing with 
insanity or delirium?” 

“But you admit there’s plenty 
about these cases that doesn’t 
figure?” 

“Sure. Did you take a look at 
the condition the world is in 
lately? Why should these old 
people be any exception?" 

I couldn’t blame him. He’d 
pulled me in on the cases with 
plenty of trouble to himself, just 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to do me a favor. Now he was 
fed up. I guess it wasn’t even 
that — he thought I was ruining 
myself, at least financially and 
maybe worse, by trying to run 
down the problem. He said he’d 
be glad to see me any time and 
gas about anything or help me 
with whatever might be bother- 
ing me, if he could, but not these 
cases any more. He told me to 
lay off them, and then he left 
me on- my own. 

I don’t know what he could 
have done, actually. I didn’t need 
him to go through the want ads 
with me, which I was doing ev- 
ery day, figuring there might be 
something in the ravings about 
an ad. I spent more time than I 
liked checking those slanted at 
old people, only to find they were 
supposed to become messengers 
and such. 

One brought, me to an old 
brownstone five -story house in 
the East 80s. I got on line with 
the rest of the applicants — there 
were men and women, all de- 
crepit, all looking badly in need 
of money — and waited my turn. 
My face was lined with collo- 
dion wrinkles and I wore an an- 
tique shiny suit and rundown 
shoes. I didn’t look more pros- 
perous or any younger than they 
did. 

I finally came up to the woman 
who was doing the interviewing. 
She sat behind a plain office 



desk down in the main floor hall, 
with a pile of application cards 
in front of her and a ballpoint 
pen in one strong, slender hand. 
She had red hair with gold lights 
in it and eyes so pale blue that 
they would have seemed the 
same color as the whites if she’d 
been on the stage. Her face 
would have been beautiful ex- 
cept for her rigid control of ex- 
pression; she smiled abruptly, 
shut it off just like that, looked 
me over with all the impersonal- 
ity and penetration of an X-ray 
from the soles to the bald head, 
exactly as she’d done with the 
others. But that skin! If it was 
as perfect as that all over her 
slim, stiffly erect, proudly shaped 
body, she had no business off the 
stage ! 

“Name, address, previous oc- 
cupation, social security num- 
ber?” she asked in a voice with 
good clarity, resonance and dic- 
tion. She wrote it all down while 
I gave the information to her. 
Then she asked me for references, 
and I mentioned Sergeant Lou 
Pape. “Fine,” she said. “We’ll 
get in touch with you if any- 
thing comes up. Don’t call us— 
we’ll call you.” 

I hung around to see who’d be 
picked. There was only one, an 
old man, two ahead of me in the 
line, who had no social security 
number, no references, not even 
any relatives or friends she could 



THE OLD DIE RICH 



IS 




have checked up on him with. 

Damn! Of course that was 
what she wanted! Hadn’t all the 
starvation cases been people with- 
out social security, references, 
either no friends and relatives or 
those they’d lost track of? 

I’d pulled a blooper, but how 
was I to know until too late? 

Well, there was a way of mak- 
ing it right. 

W HEN it was good and dark 
that evening, I stood on the 
corner and watched the lights in 
the brownstone house. The ones 
on the first two floors went out, 
leaving only those on the third 
and fourth. Closed for the day 
... or open for business? 

I got into a building a few 
doors down by pushing a button 
and waiting until the buzzer an- 
swered, then racing up to the 
roof while some man yelled down 
the stairs to §nd out who was 
there. I crossed the tops of the 
two houses between and went 
down the fire escape. 

It wasn’t easy, though not as 
tough as you might imagine. The 
fact is that I’m a whole year 
younger than Lou Pape, even if 
I could play his grandpa profes- 
sionally. I still have muscles left 
and I used them to get down the 
fire escape at the rear of the 
house. 

The fourth floor room I looked 
into had some kind of wire mesh 

16 



cage and some hooded machin- 
ery. Nobody, there. 

The third floor room was the 
redhead’s. She was coming out of 
the bathroom with a terrycloth 
bathrobe and a towel turban on 
when I looked in. She slid the 
robe off and began dusting her- 
self with powder. That skin did 
cover her. 

She turned and moved toward 
a vanity against the wall that I 
was on the other side of. The 
next thing I knew, the window 
was flung up and she had a gun 
on me. 

“Come right in — Mr. Weldon, 
isn’t it?” she said in that com- 
pletely controlled voice of hers. 
One day her control would 
crack, I thought irrelevantly, and 
the pieces would be found from 
Dallas to North Carolina. “I had 
an idea you seemed more curious 
than was justified by a help- 
wanted ad.” 

“A man my age doesn’t get 
to see many pretty girls,” I told 
her, making my own voice crack 
pathetically in a senile whinny. 

She motioned me into the 
room. When I was inside, I saw 
a light over the window blinking 
red. It stopped the moment I was 
in the room. A silent burglar 
alarm. 

She let her pale blue eyes wash 
insolently over me. “A man your 
age can see all the pretty girls he 
wants to. You’re not old. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“And you use a rinse,” I re- 
torted. 

She ignored it. “I specifically 
advertised for old people. Why 
did you apply?” 

It had happened so abruptly 
that I hadn’t had a chance to use 
the Stanislavsky method to feel 
old in the presence of a beautiful 
nude woman. I don’t even know 
if it would have worked. Noth- 
ing’s perfect. 

“1 needed a job awful bad,” I 
answered sullenly, knowing it 
sounded like an ad lib. 

S HE smiled with more contempt 
than humor. “You had a job, 
Mr. Weldon. You were very 
busy trying to find out why sen- 
ile psychotics starve themselves 
to death.” 

“How did you know that?” I 
asked, startled. 

“A little investigation of my 
own. I also happen to know you 
didn’t tell your friend Sergeant 
Pape that you were going to be 
here tonight.” 

That Was a fact, too. I hadn’t 
felt sure enough that I’d found 
the answer to call him about ft. 
Looking at the gun in her steady 
hand, I was sorry I hadn’t. 

“But you did find out I own 
this building, that my name is 
May Roberts, and that I’m the 
daughter of the late Dr. Anthony 
Roberts, the physicist,” she con- 
tinued, “Is there anything else 

T8 



you want me to tell you about 
yourself?” j 

“I know enough already. I’m j 
more interested in you and the j 
starvation cases. If you weren’t j 
connected with them, you 
wouldn’t have known I was in- I 
vestigating them.” j 

“That’s obvious, isn’t it?” She 
reached for a cigarette on the 
vanity and used a lighter with her 
free hand. The big mirror gave 
me another view of her lovely 
body, but that was beginning to 
interest me less than the gun. I 
thought of making a grab for it. 
There was too much distance be- 
tween us, though, and she knew 
better than to take her eyes off 
me while she was lighting up. 
“I’m not afraid of professional 
detectives, Mr. Weldon. They 
deal only with facts and every 
one of them will draw the same 
conclusions from a given set of 
circumstances. I don’t like ama- 
teurs. They guess too much. They 
don’t stick to reality. The re- 
sult — ” her pale eyes chilled and 
her shapely mouth went hard — 
“is that they are likely to get too 
close to the truth.” 

I wanted a smoke myself, but 
I wasn’t willing to make a move 
toward the pipe in my jacket. “I 
may be close to the truth. Miss 
Roberts, but I don’t know what 
the devil it is. I still don’t know 
how you’re tied in with the sen- 
ile psychotics or why they starve 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ith all that money. You could 
‘ me go and I wouldn’t have a 
ung on you.” 

She glanced down at herself 
id laughed for real for the first 
me. “You wouldn’t, would you? 
n the other hand, you know 
liere I'm Working from and 
uld nag Sergeant Pape into get- 
ug a search warrant. It wouldn’t 
i criminate me, but it would be 
i convenient. I don’t care to be 
i convenienced.” 

“Which means what?” 

“You want to find out my con- 
nection with senile psychotics. I 
intend to show you.” 

“How?” , 

She gestured dangerously with 
the gun. “Turn your face to the 
wall and stay that way while I 
get dressed. Make one attempt 
to turn around before I tell you 
to and I’ll shoot you. You’re 
guilty of housebreaking, you 
know. It would be a little incon- 
venient for me to have an in- 
vestigation . but not as incon- 
venient as for you.” 

FACED the wall, feeling my 
stomach braid itself into a 
tight, painful knot of fear. Of 
what, I didn’t know yet, only that 
old people who had something to 
do with her died of starvation. 
I wasn't old, but that didn't seem 
very comforting. She was the 
most frigid, calculating, deadly 
woman I’d ever met. That alone 



was enough to scare bell out of 
me. And there was the problem of 
what she was Capable of. 

Hearing the sounds of her 
dressing behind me, 1 wanted to 
lunge around and rush her, tak- 
ing a chance that she might be 
too busy pulling on a girdle or 
reaching back to fasten a bra to 
have the gun in her hand. It was , 
a suicidal impulse and I gave it 
up instantly. Other women might 
compulsively finish concealing 
themselves before snatching up 
the gun. Not her. 

“All right,” she said at last. 

I faced her. She was wearing 
coveralls that, if anything, em- 
phasized the curves of her figure. 
She had a sort of babushka that 
covered her red hair and kept it 
in place — the kind of thing wo- 
men workers used to wear in 
factories during the war. She had 
looked lethal with nothing on but 
a gun and a hard expression. She 
looked like a sentence of execu- 
tion now. 

“Open that door, turn to the 
right and go upstairs,” she told 
me, indicating directions with the 
gun. 

I went. It was the longest, most 
anxious short walk I’ve ever 
taken. She ordered me to open a 
door on the fourth floor, and we 
were inside the room I'd seen 
from the fire escape. The mesh 
cage seemed like a torture cham- 
ber to me, the hooded motors de- 



THE OLD DIE RICH

signed to shoot an agonizing cur- 
rent through my emaciating 
body. 

“You’re going to do to me what 
you did to the old man you hired 
today?” I probed, hoping for an 
answer that would really an- 
swer. 

She flipped on the switch that 
started the motors and there was 
a shrill, menacing whine. The 
wire mesh of the cage began blur- 
ring oddly, as if vibrating like 
the tines of a tuning fork. 

“You’ve been an unexpected 
nuisance, Weldon,” she said 
above the motors. “I never 
thought you’d get this far. But 
as long as you have, we might 
as well both benefit by it.” 

“Benefit?” I repeated. “ Both of 
us?” 

She opened the drawer of a 
work table and pulled out a 
stack of envelopes held with a 
rubber band. She put the stack 
at the other edge of the table. 

“Would you rather have all 
cash or bank accounts or both?” 

My heart began to beat. She 

was where the money came from i 

• 

“V7"OU trying to tell me you’re 
a philanthropist?” I de- 
manded. 

“Business is philanthropy, in a 
way,” she answered calmly. “You 
need money and I need your ser- 
vices. To that extent, we’re do- 
ing each other a favor. I think 



you’ll find that the favor I’m 
going to do for you is a pretty i 
considerable .one. Would you , 
mind picking up the envelopes j 
on the table?” i 

I took the stack and stared at 
the top envelope. “May 15, 
1931,” I read aloud, and looked 
suspiciously at her. “What’s this 
for?” 

"I don’t think it’s something 
that can be explained. At least 
it’s never been possible before and 
I doubt if it would be now. I’m . 
assuming you want both cash 
and bank accounts. Is that 
right?” 

“Well, yes. Only — ” 

“We’ll discuss it later.” She 
looked along a row of shelves 
against one wall, searching the 
labels on the stacks of bundles 
there. She drew one out and 
pushed it toward me. “Please 
open that and put on the things 
you’ll find inside.” 

I tore open the bundle. It con- 
tained a very plain business suit, 
black shoes, shirt, tie and a hat 
with a narrow brim. 

“Are these supposed to be my 
burial clothes?” 

“I asked you to put them on,” 
she said. “If you want me to 
make that a command, I’ll do it.” 

I looked at the gun and I 
looked at the clothes and then 
for some shelter I could change 
behind. There wasn’t any. 

She smiled. “You didn't seem 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



'ncerned about my modesty. I 
iD’t see why your own should 
ther you. Get dressed!” 

I obeyed, my mind anxiously 
ti using one possibility after an- 
t her, all of them ending up with 
iy death. I got into the other 
i lings and felt even more uncom- 
rtable, They were all only an 
^proximate fit: the shoes a little 

■ )o tight and pointed, the collar 

■ if the shirt too stiffly starched 
und too high under my chin, the 
gray suit too narrow at the shoul- 
ders and the ankles. I wished I 
had a mirror to see myself in. I 
felt like an ultra -conservative 
Wall Street broker and I was 
sure I resembled one, 

“All right,” she said. “Put the 
envelopes in your inside pocket. 
You’ll find instructions on each. 
Follow them carefully.” 

“I don’t get it!” I protested. 
“You will. Now step into the 
mesh cage. Use the envelopes in 
the order they’re arranged in," 
"But what’s this all about?” 

“I can tell you just one thing, 
Mr. Weldon— don’t try to es- 
cape. It can’t be done. Your other 
questions will answer themselves 
if you follow the instructions on 
the envelopes.” 

She had the gun in her hand. 
I went into the mesh cage, not 
knowing what to expect and yet 
too afraid of her to refuse. I 
didn’t want to wind up dead of 
starvation, no matter how much 



money she might have given me 
— but I didn’t want to get shot, 
either. 

She closed the mesh gate and 
pushed the switch as far as it 
would go. The motors screamed 
as they picked up speed ; the mesh 
cage vibrated more swiftly; I 
could see her through it as if 
there were nothing between us. 

And then I couldn’t see her at 
all. 

I was outside a bank on a 
sunny day in spring. 

1|/fY fear evaporated instantly 
— I’d escaped somehow! 

But then a couple of realiza- 
tions slapped me from each side. 
It was day instead of night. I 
was out on the street and not in 
her brownstone house. 

Even the season had changed! 

Dazed, I stared at the people 
passing by. They looked like 
characters in a TV movie, the 
women wearing long dresses and 
flowerpot hats, their faces made 
up with petulant rosebud mouths 
and bright blotches of rouge; the 
men in hard straw hats, suits 
with narrow shoulders, plain 
black or brown shoes — the same 
kind of clothes I was wearing. 

The rumble of traffic in the 
street caught me next. Cars with 
square boefies, tubular radia- 
tors ... 

For a moment, I let terror soak 
through me. Then I remembered 

ai 



THE OLD DIE RICH 




the mesh cage and the motors. 
May Roberts could have given 
me electro -shock, kept me under 
long enough for the season to 
change, or taken me South and 
left me on a street in daylight. 

But this was a street in New 
York. I recognized it, though 
some of the buildings seemed 
changed, the people dressed more 
shabbily. 

Shrewd stagesetting? Hypno- 
sis? 

That was it, of course! She’d 
hypnotized me ... 

Except that a subject under 
hypnosis doesn’t know he’s been 
hypnotized. 

Completely confused, I took 
out the stack of envelopes I’d 
put in my pocket. I was supposed 
to have both cash and a bank 
account, and I was outside a 
bank. She obviously wanted me 
to go in, so I did. I handed the 
top envelope to the teller. 

He hauled $150 out of it and 
looked at me as if that was 
enough to buy and sell the bank. 
He asked me if I had an account 
there. I didn’t. He took me over 
to an officer of the bank, a fellow 
with a Hoover collar and a John 
Gilbert mustache, who signed me 
up more cordially than I’d been 
treated in years. 

I walked out to the street, gap- 
ing at the entry in the bankbook 
he’d handed me. My pulse was 
jumping lumpily, my lungs re- 



fusing to work right, my head 
doing a Hopi rain dance. 

The date he’d stamped was 
May 15, 1931. 

I DIDN’T know which I was 
more afraid of — being 
stranded, middle-aged, in the 
worst of the depression, or being 
yanked back to that brown- 
stone house. I had only an in- 
stant to- realize that I was a kid 
in high school uptown right at 
that moment. Then the whole 
scene vanished as fast as blink- 
ing and I was outside another 
bank somewhere else in the city. 

The date on the enevelope was 
May 29th and it was still 1931. 
I made a $75 deposit there, then 
$100 in another place a few days 
later, and so forth, spending only 
a few minutes each time and go- 
ing forward anywhere from a 
couple of days to almost a month. 

Every now and then, I had a 
stamped, addressed envelope to 
mail at a corner box. They were 
addressed to different stock bro-: 
kers and when I got one open 
before mailing it and took a look 
inside, it turned out to be an or- 
der to buy a few hundred shares 
of stock in a soft drink company 
in the name of Dr. Anthony Rob- 
erts. I hadn’t remembered the 
price of the shares being that 
low. The last time I’d seen the 
quotation, it was more than five 
times as much as it was then. I

is making dough myself, but 
i was doing even better for May 
K'oberts. 

A few times I had to stay 
> i round for an hour or so. There 
is the night I found myself in a 
i shy speakeasy with two envel- 
opes that I was to bet the con- 
sents of, according to the instruc- 
tions on the outside. It was June 
'il, 1932, and I had to bet on Jack 
Sharkey to take the heavyweight 
title away from Max Schmeling. 

The place was serious and 
quiet — no more' than three wo- 
men, a couple of bartenders, and 
the rest male customers, includ- 
ing two cops, huddling up close 
to the radio. An affable character 
was taking bets. He gave me a 
wise little smile when I put the 
money down on Sharkey. 

“Well, it’s a pleasure to do 
business with a man who wants 
an American to win,” he said, 
“and the hell with the smart 
dough, eh?” 

“Yeah,” I said, and tried to 
smile back, but so much of the 
smart money was going on 
Schmeling that I wondered if 
May Roberts hadn’t made a mis- 
take. I couldn’t remember who 
had won. “You know what J. P. 
Morgan said — don’t sell Amer- 
ica short.” 

“I’ll take a buck for my share,” 
said a sour guy who barely man- 
aged to stand. “Lousy grass 
growing in the lousy streets, no- 



body working, no future, noth- 
ing!” 

“We’ll come out of it okay,” 

I told him confidently. 

He snorted into his gin. “Not 
in our lifetime, Mac. It’d take a 
miracle to put this country on 
its feet again. I don’t believe in 
miracles." He put his scowling 
face up close to mine and 
breathed blearily and belliger- 
ently at me, “Do you?” 

“Shut up, Gus,” one of the 
bartenders said. “The fight’s 
starting.” 

1 HAD some tough moments 
and a lot of bad Scotch, 
listening. It went the whole IS 
rounds, Sharkey won, and I was 
in almost as bad shape as Gus, 
who’d passed out halfway 
through the battle. All I can re- 
call is the affable character hand- 
ing . over a big roll and saying, 
“Lucky for me more guys don’t 
sell America short,” and trying 
to separate the money into the 
right amounts and put them into 
the right envelopes, while stum- 
bling out the door, when every- 
thing changed and I was outside 
a bank again. 

I thought, “My God, what a 
hangover cure!” I was as sober 
as if I hadn’t had a drink, when 
I made that deposit. 

There were more envelopes to 
mail and more deposits to make 
and bets to put down on Singing

Wood in 1933 at Belmont Park 
and Max Baer over Primo Car- 
nera, and then Cavalcade at 
Churchill Downs in 1934, and 
James Braddock over Baer in 
1935, and a big daily double pay- 
off, Wanoah-Arakay at Tropical 
Park, and so on, skipping through 
the years like a flat stone over 
water, touching here and there 
for a few minutes to an hour at a 
time. I kept the envelopes for 
May Roberts and myself in dif- 
ferent pockets and the bankbooks 
in another. The envelopes were 
beginning to bulge and the de- 
posits and accrued interest were 
something to watch grow. 

The whole thing, in fact, was 
so exciting that it was early Octo- 
ber of 1938 — a' total of maybe 
four or five hours subjectively — 
before I realized what she had 
me doing. I wasn’t thinking much 
about the fact that I was time 
traveling or how she did it; I 
accepted that, though the sensa- 
tion in some ways was creepy, 
like raising the dead. My father „ 
and mother, for instance, were 
still alive in 1938. If I could 
break away from whatever it was 
that kept pulling me jumpily 
through time, I could go and see 
them. 

The thought, attracted me 
enough to make me shake badly 
with intent, yet pump dread 
through me. I wanted so damned 
badly to see them again and I 



didn't dare. I couldn’t . 

Why couldn’t I? 

Maybe the machine covered 
only the area around the various 
banks, speakeasies, bars and 
horse parlors. If I could get out of 
the area, whatever it might be, I 
could avoid coming back to 
whatever May Roberts had lined 
up for me. 

Because, naturally, I knew now 
what I was doing: I was making 
deposits and winning sure bets 
just as the “senile psychotics” 
had done. The ink on their bank- 
books and bills was fresh because 
it was fresh; it wasn’t given a 
chance to oxidize — at the rate I 
was going, I’d be back to my 
own time in another few hours 
or so, with $15,000 or better in 
deposits, compound interest and 
cash. 

If I’d been around 70, you see, 
she could have sent me back to 
the beginning of the century with 
the same amount of money, 
which would have accumulated 
to something like $30,000. 

Get it now? 

I did. 

And I felt sick and frightened. 

The old people had died of 
starvation somehow with all that 
dough in cash or banks. I didn’t 
give a hang if the time travel 
was responsible, or something else 
was. I wasn’t going to be found 
dead in my hotel and have Lou 
Pape curse my corpse because

I'd been borrowing from him 
when, since 1931, I’d had a little 
fortune put away. He’d call me a 
i ' re mature senile psychotic and 
he'd be right, from his point of 
view, not knowing the truth. 

R ATHKR than make the de- 
posit in October, 1938, I 
grabbed a battered old cab and 
fold the driver to step on it. 
When I showed him the $10 bill 
that was in it for him, he squash- 
<d down the gas pedal. In 1938, 
$10 was real money. 

We got a mile away from the 
i ank and the driver looked at me 
:n the rear-view mirror. 

“How far you want to go, mis- 
ter?” 

My teeth were together so hard 
that I had to unclench them be- 
fore I could answer, “As far away 
as we can get.” 

“Cops after you?” 

“No, but somebody is. Don’t 
he surprised at anything that 
happens, no matter what it is." 

“You mean like getting shot 
at?” he asked worriedly, slowing 
down. 

“You’re not in any danger, 
friend. I am. Relax and step on 
it again.” 

I wondered if she could still 
reach me, this far from the bank, 
and handed the guy the bill. No 
justice sticking him for the ride 
in case she should. He pushed the 
pedal down even harder than 



he had been doing before. 

We must have been close to 
three miles away when I blinked 
and was standing outside the 
first bank I’d seen in 1931. 

I don’t know what the cab 
driver thought when I vanished 
out of his hack. He probably fig- 
ured I’d opened the door and 
jumped while he wasn’t looking. 
Maybe he even went back and 
searched for a body splashed all 
over the street. 

Well, it would have been a 
hopeless hunt. I was a week 
ahead. 

I gave up and drearily made 
my deposit. The one from early 
October that I’d missed I put in 
with this one. 

There was no way to escape 
the babe with the beautiful hard 
face, gorge&us warm body and 
plans for me that all seemed to 
add up to death, I didn’t try any 
more. I went on making deposits, 
mailing orders to her stock bro- 
kers, and putting down bets that 
couldn’t miss because they were 
all past history. 

I don’t even remember what 
the last one was, a fight or a 
race. I hung around the bar that 
had long ago replaced the speak- 
easy, until the inevitable payoff, 
got myself a hamburger and 
headed out the door. All the en- 
velopes I was supposed to use 
were gone and I felt shaky, know- 
ing that the next place I’d see 



THE OLD DIE RICH

was the room with the wire mesh 
cage and the hooded motors. 

It was. 

S HE was on the other side of 
the cage, and I had five bank- 
books and envelopes filled with 
cash amounting to more than 
$15,000, but all I could think of 
was that I was hungry and some- 
thing had happened to the ham- 
burger while I was traveling 
through time. I must have fallen 
and dropped it, because my hand 
was covered with dust or dirt. I 
brushed it off and quickly felt 
my face and pulled up my sleeves 
to look at my arms. 

“Very smart,” I said, “but I’m 
nowhere near emaciation.” 

“What made you think you 
would be?” she asked. 

“Because the others always 
were.” 

She cut the motors to idling 
speed and the vibrating mesh 
slowed down. I glared at her 
through it. God, she was lovely — 
as lovely as an ice sculpture! 
The kind of face you’d love to 
kiss and slap, kiss and slap . 

“You came here with a pre- 
conceived notion, Mr, Weldon. 
I’m a businesswoman, not a mon- 
ster. I like to think there’s even 
a good deal of the altruist in 
me. I could hire only young peo- 
ple, but the old ones have more 
trouble finding work. And you've 
seen for yourself how I provide 



nest eggs for them they’d other- 
wise never have.” 

“And take care of yourself at 
the same time.” 

“That’s the businesswoman in 
me. I need money .to operate.” 

. “So do the old people. Only 
they die and you don’t.” 

She opened the gate and in- 
vited me out. “I make mistakes 
occasionally. I sometimes pick 
men and women who prove to 
be too old to stand the strain. 

I try not to let it happen, but 
they need money and work so 
badly that they don’t always tell 
the truth about their age and 
state of health.” 

“You could take those who 
have social security cards and 
references.” 

“But those who don’t have 
any are in worse need!” She 
paused. “You probably think I 
want only the money you and 
they bring back, that it’s mere- 
ly some sort of profit-making 
scheme. It isn’t.” 

“You mean the idea is not just 
to build up a fortune for you 
with a cut for whoever helps 
you do it?" 

“I said I need money to oper- 
ate, Mr. Weldon, and this mehod 
serves. But there are other pur- 
poses, much more important. 
What you have gone through is 
— basic training, you might say. 
You know now that it’s possible 
to travel through time, and what 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




it’s like. The initial shock, in 
other words, is gone and you’re 
better equipped to do something 
for me in another era.” 

“Something else?” I stared at 
her puzzledly. “What else could 
you want?” 

“Let’s have dinner first. You 
must be hungry.” 

T WAS, and that reminded me : 
“I bought a hamburger just 
before you brought me back. I 
don’t know what happened to it. 
My hand was dirty and the ham- 
burger was gone, as if I’d fallen 
somehow and dropped it and got 
dirt on my hand.” 

She looked worriedly at the 
hand, probably afraid I’d cut it 
and disqualified myself. I could 
understand that; you never know 
what kind of diseases can be 
picked up in different times, be- 
cause I remember reading some- 
where that germs keep changing 
according to conditions. Right 
now, for instance, strains of bac- 
teria are becoming resistant to 
antibiotics. I knew her concern 
wasn’t really for me, but it was 
pleasant all the same. 

“That could be the explana- 
tion, I suppose,” she said. “The 
truth is that I’ve never taken a 
time voyage — somebody has to 
operate the controls in the pres- 
ent — so I can’t say it’s possible or 
impossible to fall. It must be, 
since you did. Perhaps the 



wrench back from the past was 
too violent and you slipped just 
before you returned.” / 

She led me down to an ornate 
dining room, where the table had 
been set for two. The food was 
waiting on the table, steaming 
and smelling- tasty. Nobody was 
around to serve us. She pointed 
out a chair to me and we sat 
down and began eating. I was 
a little nervous at first, afraid 
there might be something in the 
food, but it tasted fine and noth- 
ing happened after I swallowed 
a little and waited for some effect. 

“You did try to escape the 
time tractor beam, didn’t you, 
Mr. Weldon?” she asked. I didn’t 
have to answer; she knew. 
“That’s a mistaken notion of 
how it functions. 'The control 
beam doesn’t cover area ; it covers 
era. You could have flown to any 
part of the world and the beam 
would still have brought you 
back. Do I make myself clear?” 
She did. Too bloody clear. I 
waited for the rest. 

"I assume you’ve already 
formed an opinion of me,” she 
went on. “A rather unflattering 
one, I imagine.” 

“ ‘Bitch’ is the cleanest word I 
can find. But a clever one. Any- 
body who can invent a time 
machine would have to be a 
genius.” 

“I didn’t invent it. My father 
did — Dr, Anthony Robert* — us- 



THE OLD DIE RICH

ing the funds you and others 
helped me provide him with.” 
Her face grew soft and tender. 
“My father was a wonderful 
man, a great man, but he was 
called a crackpot. He was kept 
from teaching or working any- 
where. It was just as well, I sup- 
pose, though he was too hurt to 
think so; he had more leisure to 
develop the time machine. He 
could have used it to extort re- 
payment from mankind for his 
humiliation, but he didn’t. He 
used it to help mankind.” 

“Like how?” I goaded. 

“It doesn’t matter, Mr. Weld- 
on. You’re determined to hate 
me and consider me a liar. Noth- 
ing I tell you can change that.” 

S HE was right about the first 
part — I hadn’t dared let my- 
self do anything except hate and 
fear her — but she was wrong 
about the second. I remembered 
thinking how Lou Pape would 
have felt if I had died of starva- 
tion with over $15,000, after bor- 
rowing from him all the time be- 
tween jobs. Not knowing how 1 
got it, he’d have been sore, think- 
ing I’d played him for a patsy. 
What I’m trying to say is that 
Lou wouldn’t have had enough 
information to judge me. I didn’t 
have enough information yet, 
either, to judge her. 

“What do you want me to 
do?” I asked warily. 



“Everybody but one person 
was sent into the past on speci- 
fic errands — to save art treasures 
and relics that would otherwise 
have been lost to humanity.” 
“Not because the things might 
be worth a lot of dough?” I said 
nastily. 

“You’ve already seen that I 
can get all the money I want. 
There were upheavals in the past 
— great fires, wars, revolutions, 
vandalism — and I had my asso- 
ciates save things that would 
have been destroyed. Oh, beau- 
tiful things, Mr. Weldon! The 
world would have been so much 
poorer without them!” 

“El Greco, for instance?” I 
asked, remembering the raving 
old man who had been found 
wandering with $17,000 in his 
coat lining. 

“El Greco, too. Several paint- 
ings that had been lost for cen- 
turies.” She became more brisk 
and efficient-seeming. “Except 
for the one man I mentioned, I 
concentrated on the past — the 
future is too completely unknown 
to us. And there's an additional 
reason why I tentatively explored 
it only once. But the one person 
who went there discovered some- 
thing that would be of immense 
value to the world.” 

“What happened to him?” 

She looked regretful. “He was 
too old. He survived just long 
enough to tell me that the fu- 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ture has something we need. It’s 
a metal box, small enough to. 
carry, that could supply this 
whole city with power to run its 
industries and light its homes 
and streets!” 

‘‘Sounds good. Who’d you say 
benefits if I get it?” 

“We share the profits equally, 
of course. But it must be under- 
stood that we sell the power so 
cheaply that everybody can af- 
ford it.” 

“I’m not arguing. What’s the 
other reason you didn't bother 
with the future?” 

“You can’t bring anything 
from the future to the 'present 
that doesn’t exist right now. I 
won’t go into the theory, but it 
should be obvious that nothing 
can exist before it exists. You 
can’t bring the box I want, only 
the technical data to build one.” 
“Technical data? I’m an actor, 
not a scientist.” 

“You’ll have pens and weath- 
erproof notebooks to copy it 
down in.” 

1 COULDN’T make up my 
mind about her. I’ve already 
said she was beautiful, which 
always prejudices a man in a 
woman’s favor, but I couldn’t 
forget the starvation cases. They 
hadn’t shared anything but mal- 
nutrition, useless money and 
death. Then again, maybe her 
explanation was a good one, that 

THE OLD DIE RICH 



she wanted to help those who 
needed help most and some of 
them lied about their age and 
physical condition because they 
wanted the jobs so badly. All I 
knew about were those who had 
died. How did I know there 
weren’t others — a lot more of 
them than the fatal cases, per- 
haps — who came through all 
right and were able to enjoy 
their little fortunes? 

And there was her story about 
saving the treasures of the past 
and wanting to provide power at 
really low Cost. She was right 
about one thing; she didn’t need 
any of that to make money with; 
her method was plenty good 
enough, using the actual records 
of the past to invest in stocks, 
bet on sports — all sure gambles. 

But those starvation cases . , 

"Do I get any guarantees?” I 
demanded. 

She looked annoyed. “I’ll need 
you for the data. You’ll need me 
to turn it into manufacture. Is 
that enough of a guarantee?” 

“No. Do I come out of this 
alive?” 

“Mr. Weldon, please use some 
logic. I’m the one who’s taking 
the risk. I’ve already given you 
more money than you’ve ever 
had at one time in your life. Part 
of my motive was to pay for 
services about to be rendered. 
Mostly, it was to give you experi- 
ence in traveling through time.” 

29 




“And to prove to me that I 
can’t run out,” I added. 

“That happens to be a neces- 
sary attribute of the machine. I 
couldn’t very well move you 
about through time unless it 
worked that way. If you’d look 
at my point of view, you’d see 
that I lose my investment if you 
don’t bring back the data. I 
can’t withdraw your money, you 
realize." 

“I don’t know what to think,” 
I said, dissatisfied with myself 
because I couldn’t find out what, 
if anything, was wrong with the 
deal. “I’ll get you the data for 
the power box if it’s at all possi- 
ble and then we’ll see what hap- 
pens.” 

Finished eating, we went up- 
stairs and I got into the cage. 

She closed the circuit. The 
motors screamed. The mesh 
blurred. 

And I was in a world I never 
knew. 

Y OU’D call it a city, I sup- 
pose ; there were enough build- 
ings to make it one. But no citv 
ever had so much greenery, ft 
wasn’t just tree-lined streets, like 
Unter den Linden in Berlin, or 
islands covered with shrubbery, 
like Park Avenue in New York. 
The grass and trees and shrubs 
grew around every building, sep- 
arating them from each other by 
wide lawns. The buildings were 



more gla’ss — or what looked like 
glass — than anything else. A few 
of the windows were opaque 
against the sun, but I couldn’t 
see any shades or blinds. Some 
kind of polarizing glass or plas- 
tic? 

I felt uneasy being there, but 
it was a thrill just the same, to be 
alive in the future when I and 
everybody who lived in my day 
was supposed to be dead. 

The air smelled like the coun- 
try. There was nd foul gas boil- 
ing from the teardrop cars on 
the glass-level road. They were 
made of transparent plastic clear 
around and from top to bottom, 
and they moved along at a fair 
clip, but more smoothly than 
swiftly. If I hadn’t seen the air- 
ship overhead, I wouldn’t have 
known it was there. It flew si- 
lently, a graceful ball without 
wings, seeming to be borne by the 
wind from one horizon to the 
other, except that no wind ever 
moved that fast. 

One car stopped nearby and 
someone shouted, “Here we are!” 
Several people leaped out and 
headed for me. 

I didn’t think, I ran, I crossed 
the lawn and ducked into the 
nearest building and dodged 
through long, smoothly walled, 
shadowlessly lit corridors until 
I found a door that would open. 
I slammed it shut and locked it. 
Then, panting, I fell into a soft 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




chair that seemed to form itself 
around my body, and felt like 
kicking myself for the bloody 
idiot I was. 

What in hell had I run for? 
They couldn’t have known who 
I was. If I’d arrived in a time 
when people wore togas or bath- 
ing suits, there would have been 
some reason for singling me out, 
but they had all had clothes just 
like ours — suits and shirts and 
ties for the men, a dress and 
high heels for the one woman 
with them. I felt somewhat dis- 
appointed that clothes hadn’t 
changed any, but it worked out 
to my advantage; I wouldn’t be 
so conspicuous. 

Yet why should anyone have 
yelled “Here we are!” unless . 
No, they must have thought I 
was somebody else. It didn’t fig- 
ure any other way. I had run 
because it was my first startled 
reaction and probably because I 
knew I was there on what might 
be considered illegal business; if 
I succeeded, some poor inventor 
would be done out of his royal- 
ties. 

I wished I hadn’t run. Besides 
making me feel like a scared 
fool, I was sweaty and out of 
breath. Playing old men doesn’t 
make climbing down fire escapes 
much tougher than it should be, 
but it doesn’t exactly make a 
sprinter out of you — not by 
several lungfuls. 



I SAT there, breathing hard and 
trying to guess what next. I 
had no more idea of where to go 
for what I wanted than an ancient 
Egyptian set down in the middle 
of Times Square with instruc- 
tions to sneak a mummy out of 
the Metropolitan Museum. I 
didn’t even have that much in- 
formation. I didn’t know any 
part of the city, how it was laid 
out, or where to get the data that 
May Roberts had sent me for. 

I opened the door quietly and 
looked both ways before going 
out. After losing myself in the 
cross-connecting corridors a few 
times, I finally came to an out- 
side door. I stopped, tense, trying 
to get my courage. My inclina- 
tion was to slip, sneak or dart 
out, but I made myself walk 
away like a decent, innocent citi- 
zen. That was one disguise they'd 
never be able to crack. All I had 
to do was act as if I belonged to 
that time and place and who 
would know the difference? 

There were other people walk- 
ing as if they were in no hurry 
to get anywhere. I slowed down 
to their speed, but I wished wist- 
fully that there was a crowd to 
dive into and get lost. 

A man dropped into step and 
said politely, “I beg your pardon. 
Are you a stranger in town?” 

I almost halted in alarm, but 
that might have been a giveaway. 
“What makes you think so?” I 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




disked, forcing myself to keep at 
the same easy pace. 

“I — didn’t recognize your face 
»nd I thought — ” 

"It’s a big city,” I said coldly. 
"You can't know everyone.” 

“If there’s anything I can do to 
help—” 

I told him there wasn’t and 
left him standing there. It was 
plain common sense, I had de- 
cided quickly while he was talk- 
ing to me, not to take any risks 
by admitting anything. I might 
have been dumped into a police 
state or the country could have 
been at war without my knowing 
it, or maybe they were suspicious 
of strangers. For one reason or 
another, ranging from vagrancy 
to espionage, I could be pulled 
in, tortured, executed, God knows 
what. The place looked peaceful 
enough, but that didn’t prove a 
thing. 

I went on walking, looking for 
something I couldn’t be sure ex- 
isted, in a city I was completely 
unfamiliar with, in a time when 
I had no right to be alive. It 
wasn’t just a matter of getting the 
information she wanted. I’d have 
been satisfied to hang around un- 
til she pulled me back without the 
data . 

But then what would happen? 
Maybe the starvation cases were 
people who had failed her! For 
that matter, she could shoot me 
and send the remains anywhere 



in time to get rid of the evidence. 

Damn it, I didn’t know if she 
was better or worse than I’d sup- 
posed, but I wasn’t going to 
take any chances. I had to bring 
her what she wanted. 

T HERE was a sign up ahead. 

It read; to shopping center. 
The arrow pointed along the 
road. When I came to a fork and 
wondered which way to go, there 
was another sign, then another 
pointing to still more farther on. 

I followed them to the middle 
of the city, a big square with a 
park in the center and shops of 
all kinds rimming it. The only 
shop I was interested in said : 
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES. 

I went in. 

A neat young salesman came 
up and politely asked me if he 
could do anything for me. I 
sounded stupid even to myself, 
but I said, “No, thanks, I’d just 
like to do a* little browsing,” and 
gave a silly nervous laugh. Me, 
an actor, behaving like a fright- 
ened yokel! I felt ashamed of 
myself. 

He tried not to look surprised, 
but he didn’t really succeed. 
Somebody else came in, though, 
for which' I was grateful, and 
he left me alone to look around. 

I don’t know if I can get my 
feelings across to you. It’s a sit- 
uation that nobody would ever 
expect to find himself in, so it

isn’t easy to tell what it’s like. 
But I've got to try. 

Let’s stick with the ancient 
Egyptian I mentioned a while 
back, the one ordered to sneak 
a mummy out of the Metropoli- 
tan Museum. Maybe that’ll make 
it clearer. 

The poor guy has no money 
he can use, naturally, and no 
idea of what New York’s trans- 
portation system is like, where 
the museum is, how to get there, 
what visitors to a museum do and 
say, the regulations he might un- 
wittingly break, how much an 
ordinary citizen is supposed to 
know about which customs and 
such. Now add the possible dan- 
ger that he might be slapped into 
jail or an insane asylum if he 
makes a mistake and you’ve got 
a rough notion of the spot I felt 
I was in. Being able to speak 
English doesn’t make much dif- 
ference; not knowing what’s re- 
garded as right and wrong, and 
the unknown consequences, are 
enough to panic anybody. 

That doesn’t make it clear 
enough. f 

Well, look, take the electrical 
appliances in that store; that 
might give you an idea of the 
situation and the way -it affected 
me. 

The appliances must have been 
as familiar to the people of that 
time as toasters and TV sets and 
lamps are to us. But the things 



didn’t make a bit of sense to me 
. any more than our appli- 
ances would to the ancient Egyp- 
tian. Can you imagine him trying 
to figure out what those items 
are for and how they work? 

H ERE are some gadgets you 
can puzzle over: 

There was a light fixture that 
you put against any part of a 
wall — no screws, no cement, no 
wires, even — and it held there and 
lit up, and it stayed lit no matter 
where you moved it on the wall. 
Talk about pin-up lamps . 
this was really it ! 

Then I came across something 
that looked like an ashtray with 
a blue electric shimmer obscuring 
the bottom of the bowl, I lit my 
pipe — others I’d passed had been 
smoking, so I knew it was safe 
to do the same — and flicked in 
the match. It disappeared. I 
don’t mean it was swirled into 
some hidden compartment. It 
vanished. I emptied the pipe into 
the ashtray and that went, too. 
Looking around to make sure 
nobody was watching. I dredged 
some coins out of my pocket and 
let them drop into the tray. They 
were gone. Not a particle of them 
was left. A disintegrator? I 
haven’t got the slightest idea. 

There were little mirror boxes 
with three tiny dials on the front 
of each. 1 turned the dials on 
one — it was like using three dial

telephones at the same time — 
and a pretty girl’s face popped 
onto the mirror surface and 
looked' 4 expectantly at me. 

“Yes?” she said, and waited for 
me to answer. 

“I — uh — wrong number, I 
guess,” I answered, putting the 
box down in a hurry and going 
to the other side of the shop be- 
cause I didn’t have even a dim 
notion how to turn it off. 

The thing I was looking for 
was on a counter — a tinted metal 
box no bigger than a suitcase, 
with a lipped hole on top and 
small undisguised verniers in 
front, I didn’t know I’d found 
it, actually, until I twisted a ver- 
nier and every light in the store 
suddenly glared and the sales- 
man came rushing over and po- 
litely moved me aside to shut it 
off. 

“We don’t want to burn out 
every appliance in the place, do 
we?” he asked quietly. 

“I just wanted to see if it 
worked all right,” I said, still 
shaking slightly. It could have 
blown up or electrocuted me, for 
all I knew. 

“But they always work,” he 
said. 

“Ah — always?” 

“Of course. The principle is 
simple and there are no parts to 
get worn out, so they last indefi- 
nitely,” He suddenly smiled as 
if he’d just caught the gist. “Oh, 



you were joking! Naturally — 
everybody learns about the Dy- 
napack in primary education. 
You were interested in acquiring 
one?” 

“No, no. The — the old one is 
good enough. I was just — well, 
you know, interested in knowing 
’ if the new models are much dif- 
ferent or better than the old 
ones.” 

“But there haven’t been any 
new models since 2073,” he said. 
“Can you think of any reason 
why there should be?” 

“I — guess not,” I stammered. 
“But you never can tell.” 

“You can with Dynapacks,” he 
said, and he would have gone on 
if I hadn’t lost my nerve and 
mumbled my way out of the 
store as fast as I could. 

Y OI>want to know why? He’d 
asked me if I wanted to “ac- 
quire” a Dynapack, not buy one. 
I didn’t know what “acquire” 
meant in that society. It could be 
anything from saving up coupons 
to winning whatever you wanted 
at some kind of lottery, or maybe 
working up the right number of 
labor units on the job — in which 
case he’d want to know where I 
was employed and the equivalent 
of social security and similar in- 
formation, which I naturally 
didn’t have — or it could just be 
fancy sales talk for buying. 

I couldn’t guess, and I didn’t 



THE OLD DIE RICH 



35 




care to expose myself any more 
than I had already. And my 
blunder about the Dynapack 
working and the new models was 
nothing to make me feel at all 
easier. 

Lord, the uncertainties and 
hazards of being in a world you 
don’t know anything about! Day- 
dreaming about visiting another 
age may be pleasant, but the 
reality is something else again. 

“Wait a minute, friend!” I 
heard the salesman call out be- 
hind me. 

¥ looked back as casually, I 
-*■ hoped, as the pedestrians who 
heard him. He was walking 
quickly toward me with a very 
worried expression on his face. I 
stepped up my own pace as un- 
obtrusively as possible, trying 
to keep a lot of people between 
us, meanwhile praying that they’d 
think I was just somebody who 
was late for an appointment. The 
salesman didn’t break into a run 
or yell for the cops, but I couldn’t 
be sure he wouldn’t. 

As soon as I came to a corner, 3 
turned it and ran like hell. There 
was a sort of alley down the 
block. I jumped into it, found a 
basement door and stayed in- 
side, pressed against the wall, 
quivering with tension and suck- 
ing air like a swimmer who’d 
stayed underwater too long. 

Even after I got my wind back, 



I wasn’t anxious to go out. The 
place could have been cordoned 
off, with the police, the army and 
the navy all cooperating to nab 
me. 

What made me think so? Not 
a thing except remembering how 
puzzled our ancient Egyptian 
would have been if he got arrested 
in the subway for something ev- 
erybody did casually and with- 
out punishment in his own time 
— spitting! I could have done 
something just as innocent, as far 
as you and I are concerned, that 
this era would consider a mis- 
demeanor or a major crime. And 
in what age was ignorance of the 
law ever an excuse? 

Instead of going back out, I 
prowled carefully into the build- 
ing. It was strangely silent and 
deserted. I couldn’t understand 
why until I came to a lavatory. 
There were little commodes and 
wash basins that came up to 
barely above my knees. The place 
was a school. Naturally it was 
deserted — the kids were through 
for the day. 

I could feel the tension dissolve 
in me like a ramrod of ice melt- 
ing, no longer keeping my back 
and neck stiff and taut. There 
probably wasn’t a better place 
in the city for me to hide. 

A primary school! 

The salesman had said to me, 
"Everybody learns about the Dy- 
napack in primary education.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



G OING through the school was 
eerie, like visiting a familiar 
childhood scene that had been 
distorted by time into something 
almost totally unrecognizable. 

There were no blackboards, 
teacher’s big desk, children’s lit- 
tle desks, inkwells, pointers, 
globes or books. Yet it was a 
school. The small fixtures in the 
lavatory downstairs had told me 
that, and so did the miniature 
chairs drawn neatly under the 
low, vividly painted tables in the 
various schoolrooms. A large 
comfortable chair was evidently 
where the teacher sat when not 
wandering around among the 
pupils. 

In front of each chair, firmly 
attached to the table, was a box 
with a screen, and both sides of 
the box held spools of wire on 
blunt little spindles. The spools 
had large, clear numbers on them. 
Near the teacher’s chair was a 
compact case with more spools 
on spindles, and there was a 
large screen on the inside wall, 
opposite the enormous windows. 

I went into one of the rooms 
and sat down in the teacher’s 
chair, wondering how I was go- 
ing to find out about the Dyna- 
pack. I felt like an archeologist 
guessing at the functions of 
strange relics he’d found in a 
dead city. 

Sitting in the chair was like 
sitting on a column of air that 



let me sit upright or slump as I 
chose. One of the arms had a 
row of buttons. I pressed one 
and waited nervously to find out 
if I’d done something that woulii 
get me into trouble. 

Concealed lights in the ceil- 
ing and walls began glowing, get- 
ting brighter, while the room 
gradually turned dark. I glanced 
arouryjl bewilderedly to see why, 
because it was still daylight. 

The windows seemed to be slid- 
ing slightly, very slowly, and as 
they slid, the sunlight was 
damped out. I grinned, thinking 
of what my ancient Egyptian 
would make of that. I knew there 
were two sheets of polarizing 
glass, probably with a vacuum 
between to keep out the cold 
and the heat, and the lights in 
the room were beautifully syn- 
chronized with the polarized slid- 
ing glass. 

I wasn’t doing so badly. The 
rest of the objects might not be 
too hard to figure out. 

The spools in the case along- 
side the teacher’s chair could be 
wire recordings. I looked for 
something to play them with, 
but there was no sign of a play- 
back machine. I tried to lift a 
spool off a spindle. It wouldn’t 
come off. 

Hah! The wire led down the 
spindle to the base of the box, 
holding the spool in place. That 
meant the spools could be played 



THE OLD DIE RICH

right in that position. But what 
started them playing? 

1 HUNTED over the box mi- 
nutely. Every part of it was 
featureless — no dials, switches or 
any unfamiliar counterparts. I 
even tried moving my hands over 
it, figuring it might be like a 
theramin, and spoke to it in 
different shades of commai^, be- 
cause it could have been built to 
respond to vocal orders. Nothing 
happened. 

Remember the Poe story that 
shows the best place to hide 
something is right out in the 
open, which is the last place 
anyone would look? Well, these 
things weren't manufactured to 
baffle people, any more than our 
devices generally are. But it’s 
only by trying everything that 
somebody who didn’t know what 
a switch is would start uf> a 
vacuum cleaner, say, or light a 
big chandelier from a wall clear 
across the room. 

I’d pressed every inch of the 
box, hoping some part of it mighj 
act as a switch, and I finally 
touched one of the spindles. The 
spool immediately began spin- 
ning at a very low speed and 
the screen on the wall opposite 
the window glowed into life. 

“The history of the explora- 
tion of the Solar System,” said 
an announcer’s deep voice, “is 
one of the most adventuresAme 



in mankind’s long list of achieve- 
ments. Beginning with the crude 
rockets developed during World 
War II ...” 

There were newsreel shots of 
V-l and V-2 being blasted from 
their takeoff ramps and a mon- 
tage of later experimental models. 

I wished I could see how it all 
turned out, but I was afraid to 
waste the time watching. At any 
moment, I might hear the foot- 
steps of a guard or janitor or 
whoever tended buildings then. 

I pushed the spindle again. It 
checked the spool, which re- 
wound swiftly and silently, and 
stopped itself when the rewind- 
ing was finished. I tried another. 
A nightmare underwater scene 
appeared. 

“With the aid of energy 
screens,” said another voice, “the 
oceans of the world were com- 
pletely charted by the year 
2027 ...” ■ 

I turned it off, then another on 
developments in medicine, one 
on architecture, one on history, 
the geography of such places as 
the interior of South America 
and Africa that were — or are — 
unknown today, and I was get- 
ting frantic, starting the won- 
derful wire films that held 
full-frequency sound and pic- 
tures in absolutely faithful color, 
and shutting them off hastily 
when I discovered they didn’t 
have what I was looking for.

They were courses for chil- 
dren, but they all contained in- 
formation that our scientists are 
still groping for . and I 
couldn’t chance watching one all 
the way through! 

I was frustratedly switching off 
a film on psychology when a 
female voice said from the door, 
“May I help you?" 

I SNAPPED around to face 
her in sudden fright. She was 
young and slim and slight, but 
she could scream loud enough to 
get help. Judging by the way she 
was looking at me, outwardly 
polite and yet visibly nervous, 
that scream would be coming at 
any second. 

“T must have wandered in 
here by mistake,” I said, and 
pushed past her to the corridor, 
where I began running back the 
way I had come. 

“But you don’t understand!” 
she cried after me. “I really want 
to help — ” 

Yeah, help, I thought, pound- 
ing toward the street door. A gag» 
right out of that psychology film, 
probably — get the patient to hold 
still, humor him, until you can 
get somebody to put him where 
he belongs. That's what one of 
our teachers would do, provided 
she wasn’t too scared to think 
straight, if she found an old- 
looking guy thumbing frenziedly 
through the textbooks in a gram- 



mar school classroom. 

When I came to the outside 
door, I stopped. I had no way 
of knowing whether she’d given 
out an alarm, or how she might 
have done it, but the obvious 
place to find me would be out on 
the street, dodging for cover 
somewhere. 

I pushed the door open and let 
it slam shut, hoping she’d hear 
it upstairs. Then I found a door, 
sneaked it open and went silently 
down the steps. 

In the basement, I looked for 
a furnace or a coal bin or a 
fuel tank to hide behind, but 
there weren’t any. I don’t know 
how they got their heat in the 
winter or eooled the building in 
the summer. Probably some cen- 
tral atomic plant that took care 
of the whole city, piping in the 
heat or coolant in underground 
conduits that were led up through 
the walls, because there weren’t 
even any pipes visible. 

I hunched into the darkest 
corner I could find and hoped 
they wouldn't look for me there. 

B Y the time night came, 
hunger drove me out of the 
school, but I did it warily, mak- 
ing sure nobody was in sight. 

The streets of the shopping 
center were more or less deserted. 
There was no sign of a restaur- 
ant. 1 was so empty that I felt 
dizzy as I hunted for one. But

'lien a shocking realization made 
ne halt on the sidewalk and 
weat with horror. 

Even if there had been a res- 
taurant, what would I have used 
for money? 

Now I got the whole foul pic- 
' i ire. She had sent old people 
ack through time on errands 
like mine . and they’d starved 
to death because they couldn’t 
buy food! 

No, that wasn’t right. I re- 
nembered what I had told Lou 
’ape : anybody who gets hungry 
nough can always find a truck 
. irden or a food store to rob. 

Only ... 1 hadn’t seen a truck 
. irden or food store anywhere in 
this city. 

And ... I thought about peo- 
ple in the past having their hands 
rut off for stealing a loaf of 
bread. 

This civilization didn’t look as 
if it went in for such drastic pun- 
ishments, assuming I could find 
a loaf of bread to steal. But 
neither did most of the civiliza- 
tions that practiced those bar- 
barisms. 

I was more tired, hungry and 
scared than I’d ever believed a 
human being could get. Lost, 
completely lost in a. totally alien 
world, but one in which I could 
still be killed or starve to death 
. and God knew what was wait- 
ing for me in my own time in 
case I came back without the 



information she wanted. 

Or maybe even if I came back 
with it! 

That suspicion made up rfiy 
mind for me. Whatever happened 
to me now couldn’t be worse than 
what she might do. At least I r 
didn’t have to starve. 

I stopped a man in the street. 

I let several others go by before 
picking him deliberately because 
he was middle-aged, had a kind- 
ly face, and was smaller than 
me, so I could slug him and run 
if he raised a row. 

“Look, friend,” I told him, "I’m 
just passing through town — ” 

“Ah?” he said pleasantly. 

“ — And I seem to have mis- 
laid- — ” No, that was dangerous. 
I’d been about to say I’d mis- 
laid my wallet, but I still didn't 
know whether they used money 
in this era. He waited with a 
patient, friendly smile while I 
decided just how to put it. “The 
fact is that I haven’t eaten all 
day and I wonder if you could 
help me get a meal.” 

He said in the most neighborly 
voice imaginable, “I’ll be glad 
to do anything I can, Mr. Weld- 
on,” 

M Y entire face seemed to drop 
open. “You — you called 
me — ” 

“Mr. Weldon,” he repeated, 
still looking up at me with that 
neighborly smile. “Mark Weld-

on, isn’t it? From the 20th Cen- 
tury?” 

I tried to answer, but my throat 
had tightened up worse than on 
any opening night I’d ever had 
to live through. I nodded, won- 
dering terrifiedly what was go- 
ing on. 

“Please relax,” he said persua- 
sively. “You’re not ib any dan- 
ger whatever. We offer you our 
utmost hospitality. Our time, you 
might say, is your time.” 

“You know who I am,” I man- 
aged to get out through my con- 
stricted glottis. “I’ve been doing 
all this running arid ducking and 
hiding for nothing.” 

He shrugged sympathetically. 
“Everyone in the city was in- 
structed to help you, but you 
were so nervous that we were 
afraid to alarm you with a direct 
approach. Every time we tried 
to, as a matter of fact, you van- 
ished into one .place or another. 
We didn’t follow for fear of the 
effect on you. We had to wait un- 
til you came voluntarily to u»” 
My brain was racing again 
and getting nowhere. Part of it 
was dizziness from hunger, but 
only part. The rest was plain 
frightened confusion. 

They knew who I was. They’d 
been expecting me. They prob- 
ably even knew what I was after. 
And they wanted, to help! 
“Let’s not go into explana- 
tions now,” he said, "although 



I’d like to smooth away the be- 
wilderment and fear on your face. 
But you need to be fed first. Then 
we'll call in the others and — " 

I pulled back. “What others? 
How do I know you’re not set- 
ting up something for me that I’ll 
wish I hadn’t gotten into?” 
“Before you approached me, 
Mr. Weldon, you first had to 
decide that we represented no 
greater menace than May Rob- 
erts. Please believe me, we don’t.” 
So he knew about that, too! 
“All right. I’ll take my 
chances,” I gave in resignedly. 
“Where does a guy find a place 
to eat in this city?” 

I T was a handsome restaurant 
with soft light coming from 
three-dimensional, full-color na- 
' ture murals that I might mis- 
takenly have walked into if I’d 
been alone, they looked so much 
like gardens and forests and 
plains. It was no wonder I 
couldn’t find a restaurant or food 
store or truck garden anywhere 
— food came up through pneu- 
matic chutes in each building, I’d 
been told on the way over, grown 
in hydroponic tanks in cities that 
specialized in agriculture, and 
those who wanted to eat “out” 
could drop into the restaurant 
each building had. Every city 
had its own function. This one 
was for people in the arts. I liked 
that.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There was a glowing menu on 
the table with buttons alongside 
the various selections, I looked 
starvingly at the items, trying to 
decide which I wanted most. I 
picked oysters, onion soup, breast 
of guinea hen under plexiglas and 
was hunting for the tastiest and 
most recognizable dessert when 
the pleasant little guy shook his 
head regretfully and emphatic- 
ally. 

“I’m afraid you can’t eat any 
of those foods) Mr. Weldon,” he 
said in a sad voice. “We’ll ex- 
plain why in a moment.’’ 

A waiter and the manager came 
over. They obviously didn’t want 
to stare at me, but they couldn't 
help it. I couldn’t blame them. 
I’d have stared at somebody 
from George Washington’s time, 
which is about what I must have 
represented to them. 

“Will you please arrange to 
have the special food for Mr. 
Weldon delivered here immedi- 
ately?” the little guy asked. 

“Every restaurant has been 
standing by for this, Mr. Carr,” 
said the manager. “It’s on its 
way. Prepared, of course — it’s 
been ready since he first arrived.” 

“Fine,” said the little guy, 
Carr, “It can’t be too soon. He’s 
very hungry.” 

I glanced around and noticed 
for the first time that there was 
nobody else in the restaurant. It 
was past the dinner hour, but. 



even so, there are always late 
diners. We had the place all to 
ourselves and it bothered me. 
They could have ganged up on 
me . 

But they didn’t. A light gong 
sounded, and the waiter and 
manager hurried over to a slot 
of a door and brought out a 
couple of trays loaded with cov- 
ered dishes, 

“Your dinner, Mr. Weldon,” 
the manager said, putting the 
plates in front of me and remov- 
ing.the lids. 

I stared down at the food. 

“This,” I told them angrily, 
“is a hell of a trick to play on 
a starving man!” 

HEY all looked unhappy. 
“Mashed dehydrated pota- 
toes, canned meat and canned 
vegetables,” Carr replied. “Not 
very appetizing. I know, but I’m 
afraid it’s all we can allow you 
to' eat.” 

I took the cover off the dessert 
dish. 

“Dried fruits!” I said in dis- 
gust. 

“Rather excessively dried, I’m 
sorry to say,” the manager agreed 
mournfully. 

I sipped the blue stuff in a 
glass and almost spat it out. 
“Powdered milk! Are these things 
what you people have to live on?” 

“No, our diet is quite varied,” 
Carr said in embarrassment. 




THE OLD DIE RICH

“But we unfortunately can’t give 
you any of the foods we normally 
eat ourselves.” 

“And why in blazes not?” 
“Please eat, Mr. Weldon,” 
Carr begged with frantic earn- 
estness. “There’s so much to ex- 
plain — this is part of it, of course 
— and it would be best if you 
heard it on a full stomach.” 

I was famished enough to get 
the stuff down, which wasn’t 
easy; uninviting as it looked, it 
tasted still worse. 

When I was through, Carr 
pushed several buttons on the 
glowing menu. Dishes came up 
from an opening in the center 
of the table and he showed me 
the luscious foods they contained. 

“Given your choice," he said, 
“you’d have preferred them to 
what you have eaten. Isn’t that 
so, Mr. Weldon?” 

“You bet I would!” I answered, 
sore because 1 hadn’t been given 
that choice. 

“And you would have died like 
the pathetic old people you ware 
investigating,” said a voice be- 
hind me. 

I turned around, startled. Sev- 
eral men and women had come 
in while I’d been eating, their 
footsteps as silent as cats on a 
rug. I looked blankly from them 
to Carr and back again. 

“These are the clothes we or- 
dinarily wear,” Carr said. “An 
18th Century motif, as you can 



see — updated knee breeches and 
shirt waists, a modified stock for 
the men, the daring low bodices 
of that era, the full skirts treated 
in a modern way by using sheer 
materials for the women, bright 
colors and sheens, buckled shoes 
of spun synthetics. Very gay, very 
ornamental, very comfortable, 
and thoroughly suitable to our 
time.” 

“But everybody I saw was 
dressed like me!” I protested. 

"Only to keep you from feel- 
ing more conspicuous and anxious 
than you already were. It was 
quite a project, I can tell you — 
your styles varied so greatly 
from decade to decade, especially 
those for women — and the mate- 
rials were a genuine problem; 
they’d gone out of existence long 
ago. We had the textile and tail- 
oring cities working a full six 
months to clothe the inhabitants 
of this city, including, of course, 
the children. Everybody had to 
be clad as your contemporaries 
were, because we knew only that 
you would arrive in this vicinity, 
not where you might wander 
through the city.” 

“There was one small differ- 
ence you didn’t notice,” added a 
handsome mature woman. "You 
were the only man in a gray suit. 
We had a full description of 
what you were wearing, you sec, 
and we made sure nobody else 
was dressed that way. Naturally, 



everyone knew who you were, 
and so we were kept informed of 
your movements.” 

“What for?” I demanded in 
alarm. “What’s this all about?” 

P ULLING up chairs, they sat 
down, looking to me like a 
witchcraft jury from some old 
painting. 

“I’m Leo Blundell,” said a tall 
man in plum-and-gold clothes. 
“As chairman of — of the Mark 
Weldon Committee, it’s my re- 
sponsibility to handle this project 
correctly.” 

“Project?” 

“To make certain that history 
is fulfilled, I have to tell you 
as much as you must know." 

“I wish somebody would!” 
“Very well, let me begin by 
telling you much of what you 
undoubtedly know already. In a 
sense, you- are more a victim of 
Dr. Anthony Roberts than his 
daughter. Roberts was a brilliant 
physicist, but because of his ec- 
centric behavior, he was ridiculed 
for his theories and hated for his 
arrogance. He was an almost per- 
fect example of self-defeat, the 
way in which a man will hamper 
his career and wreck his happi- 
ness, and then blame the world 
for his failure and misery. To get 
back to his connection with you, 
however, he invented a time ma- 
chine — unfortunately, its secret 
has since been lost and never re- 



discovered — and used it for anti- 1 
social purposes. When he died, 
his daughter May carried on his 
work. It was she who sent you 
to this time to learn the prin- 
ciple by which the Dynapack op- 
erates. She was a thoroughly 
ruthless woman.” 

“Are ypu sure?” I asked un- 
easily. 

“Quite sure.” 

“I know a number of old peo- 
ple died after she sent them on 
errands through time, but she 
said they’d lied about their age 
and health.” 

“One would expect her to say 
that,” a woman put in cuttingly. 

Blundell turned to her and 
shook his head. “Let Mr. Weldon 
clarify his feelings about her, 
Rhoda. They are obviously very 
mixed.” 

“They are,” I admitted. “She 
seemed hard, the first time I saw 
her, when I answered her ad, but 
she could have been just acting 
businesslike. I mean she had a lot 
of people to pick from and she 
had to be impersonal and make 
certain she had the right one. 
The next time — 1 hope you don’t 
know about that — it was really 
my fault for breaking into her 
room. I really had a lot of ad- 
miration for the way she handled 
the situation.” 

“Go on,” Carr encouraged me. 

“And I can’t complain about 
the deal she gave me. Sure, she

litne out ahead on the money I 
l>ct and invested for her. But I 
did all right myself — I was richer 
than I’d ever been in my life — 
and she gave that money to me 
before I even did anything to 
earn it!” 

“Besides which,” somebody else 
said, “she offered you half of 
the profits on the Dynapiack.” 

f LOOKED around at the faces 
for signs of hostility. I saw 
none. That was surprising. I’d 
come from the past to steal some- 
thing from them and they weren’t 
it all angry. Well, no, it wasn’t 
leally stealing. I wouldn’t be de- 
priving them of the Dynapack. 
It just would have been invented 
before it was supposed to be. 

“She did,” I said. “Though I 
wouldn’t call that part of it phil- 
anthropy. She needed me for the 
data and I needed her to manu- 
facture the things.” 

“And she was a very beau- 
tiful woman,” Blundell added. 

I squirmed a bit. “Yes.” 

“Mr. Weldon, we know a good 
deal about her from notes that 
have come down to us among 
her private papers. She had a 
safety deposit box under a false 
name. I won’t tell you the name; 
it was not discovered until many 
years later, and we will not vol- 
untarily meddle with the past.’’ 
I sat up and listened sharply. 
“So that’s how you knew who I 



was and what I’d be wearing and 
what I came for! You even knew 
when and where I’d arrive!” 
“Correct,” Blundell said. 
“What else do you know?” 
“That you suspected her of be- 
ing responsible for the deaths of 
many old people by starvation. 
Your suspicion was justified, ex- 
cept that her father had caused 
all those that occurred before 
1947, when she took over after 
his own death. All but two people 
were sent into the past. Roberts 
was curious about the future, of 
course, but he did not want to 
waste a victim on a trip that 
would probably be fruitless. In 
the past, you understand, he 
knew precisely what he was after. 
The future was completely un- 
known territory.” 

“But she took the chance,” I 
said. 

“If you can* call deliberate 
murder taking a chance, yes. One 
man arrived in 2094, over fifty 
years ago. The other was your- 
self. The first one, as you know, 
died of malnutrition when he was 
brought back to your era.” 

“And what happened to me?” 
I asked, jittering. 

“You will not die. We intend 
to make sure of that. All the 
other victims — I presume you’re 
interested in their errands?” 

“I think I know, but I’d like 
to find out just the same.” 
“They were sent to the past 



THE OLD DIE RICH

to buy or steal treasures of vari- 
ous sorts— art, sculpture, jewelry, 
fabulously valuable manuscripts 
and books, anything that had 
great scarcity value.” 

“That’s not possible,” I object- 
ed. “She had all the money she 
wanted. Any time she needed 
more, all she had to do was send 
somebody back to put down bets 
and buy stocks that she knew 
were winners. She had the rec- 
ords, didn’t she? There was no 
way she or her father could 
lose!” 

H E moved his shoulders in a 
plum-and-gold shrug. “Most 
of the treasures they accumu- 
lated were for acquisition’s sake 
— and for the sake of vengeance 
for the way they believed Dr. 
Roberts had been treated. When 
there were unusual expenses, 
such as replacing the very costly 
parts of the time machine, that 
required more than they could 
produce in ready cash, both 
Roberts and his daughter ‘dis- 
covered’ these treasures.” ' 
He waited while I digested 
the miserable meal and the dis- 
turbing information he had given 
me. I thought I’d found a loop- 
hole in his ^explanation : “You 
said people were sent back to the 
past to buy treasures, besides 
stealing them.” 

“I did,” he agreed. “They were 
provided with currency of what- 



ever era they were to visit.” 

I felt my forehead wrinkle up 
as my theory fell apart. “Then 
they could buy food. Why should 
they have died of malnutrition?” 
“Because, as May Roberts her- 
self told you, nothing can exist 
before jt exists. Neither can any- 
thing exist after it is out of ex- 
istence. If you returned with a 
Dynapack, for example, it would 
revert to a lump of various 
metals, because that was what 
it was in your period. But let 
me give you a more personal in- 
stance. Do you remember com- 
ing back from your first trip 
with dust on your hand?” 

“Yes. I must have fallen.” 

“On one hand? No, Mr. Wel- 
don. May Roberts was greatly 
upset by the incident; she was 
afraid you would realize why the 
hamburger had turned to dust — 
and why the old people died of 
starvation. All of them, not just 
a few.” 

He paused, giving me a chance 
to understand what he had just 
said. I did, with a sick shock. 

“If I ate your food,” I said 
shakily, “I’d feel satisfied until 
I was returned to my own time. 
But the food wouldn’t go along 
with me!" 

B LUNDELL nodded gravely. 

“And so you, too, would die 
of malnutrition. The foods we 
have given you existed in your

^ fra. We were very careful of 
that, so careful that many of 
i hem probably were stored years 
''-fore you left your time, We 
i egret that they are not very 
palatable, but at least we are 
positive they will go back with 
you. You will be as healthy when 
you arrive in the past as when 
you left. 

“Incidentally, she made you 
hange your clothes for the same 
reason — they had been made in 
1930. She had clothing from 
very era she wanted visited and 
i hose old people who would fit 
them best. Otherwise, you see, 
they’d have arrived naked.” 

I began to shake as if I were 
is old as I’d pretended to be on 
the stage. “She’s going to pull 
me back! If I don’t bring her the 
information about the Dynapack, 
she’ll shoot me!” 

“That, Mr. Weldon, is our 
problem,” Blundell said, putting 
his hand comfortingly on my arm 
to calm me. 

“Your problem? I’m the one 
who’ll get shot, not you!” 

“But we know in complete de- 
tail what will happen when you 
are returned to the 20th Cen- 
tury.” 

I pulled my arm away and 
grabbed his. “You know that? 
Tell me!” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Weldon, If we 
tell you what you did, you might 
thing of some alternate action, 



and there is no knowing what the 
result would be.” 

“But I didn’t get shot or die 
of malnutrition?” 

“That much we can tell you. 
Neither.” 

They all stood up, so bright 
and attractive in their colorful 
clothes that I felt like a shirt- 
sleeved stage hand who’d wan- 
dered in on a costume play. 

“You will be returned in a 
month, according to the notes 
May Roberts left. She gave you 
plenty of time to get* the data, 
you see. We propose to make 
that month an enjoyable one 
for you. The resources of our city 
— and any others you care to visit 
— are at your disposal. We wish 
you to take full advantage of 
them.” 

“And the Dynapack?” 

“Let us worry about that. We 
want you to have a good time 
while you are our guest.” 

I did. 

It was the most wonderful 
month of my life. 

T HE mesh cage blurred around 
me. I could see May Roberts 
through it, her hand just leaving 
the switch. She was as beautiful 
as ever, but I saw beneath her 
beauty the vengeful, vicious crea- 
ture her father’s bitterness had 
turned her into ; Blundell and 
Carr had let me read some of 
her notes, and I knew. I wished 



THE OLD DIE RICH

I could have spent the rest of 
my years in the future, instead 
of having to come back to this. 

She came over and opened the 
gate, smiling like an angel wel- 
coming a bright new soul. Then 
her eyes traveled startledly over 
me and her smile almost dropped 
off. But she held it firmly in 
place. 

She had to, while she asked, 
“Do you have the notes I sent 
you for?” 

“Right here,” I said. 

I reached into my breast pocket 
and brought out a stubby auto- 
matic and shot her through the 
right arm. Her closed hand open- 
ed and a little derringer clanked 
on the floor. She gaped at me 
with an expression of horrified 
surprise that should have been 
recorded permanently; it would 
have served as a model for gen- 
erations of actors and actresses. 

“You — brought back a weap- 
on!” she gasped. “You shot me!” 
She stared vacantly at her bleed- 
ing arm and then at my auto- 
matic. “But you can’t — brin£ 
anything back from the future. 
And you aren’t — dying of mal- 
nutrition.” 

She said it all in a voice shock- 
ed into toneless wonder. 

“The food I ate and this gun 
are from the present,” I said. 
“The people of the future knew 
I was coming. They gave me food 
that wouldn’t vanish from my 




cells when I returned. They also 
gave me the gun instead of the 
plans for the Dynapsck.” 

“And you took it?” she scream- 
ed at me. "You idiot! I’d have 
shared the profits honestly with 
you. You’d have been worth 
millions!” 

“With acute malnutrition,” I 
amended. “I like it better this 
way, thanks — poor, but alive. Or 
relatively poor, I should say, be- 
cause you’ve been very generous 
and I appreciate it.” 

“By shooting me!” 

“I hated to puncture that love- 
ly arm, but it wasn’t as painful 
as starving or getting shot my- 
self. Now if you don’t mind — or 
even if you do — it’s your turn 
to get into the cage, Miss Rob- 
erts.” 

She tried to grab for the der- 
ringer on the floor with her left 
hand. 

“Don’t bother,” I said quietly. 
“You can’t reach it before a 
bullet reaches you.” 

# 

S HE straightened up, staring at 
me for the first time with 
terror in her eyes. 

“What are you going to do 
to me?” she whispered. 

“I could kill you as easily as 
you could have -killed me. Kill 
you and send your body into 
some other era. How many dozens 
of deaths were you responsible 
for? The law couldn’t convict 



you of them, but I can. And I 
couldn’t be convicted, either.” 

She put her hand on the 
wound. Blood seeped through her 
fingers as she lifted her chin 
at me. 

“I won’t beg for my life, Wel- 
don, if that’s what you want. 1 
could offer you a partnership, but 
I’m not really in a position to 
offer it, am I?” 

She was magnificent, terrify- 
ingly intelligent, brave clear 
through . and deadlier than a 
plague. I had to remember that. 

“Into the cage,” I said. “I have 
some friends in the future who 
have plans for you. I won’t tell 
you what they are, of course; you 
didn’t tell me what I’d go 
through, did you? Give my 
friends my fondest regards. If I 
can manage it, I’ll visit them — 
and you.” 

She backed warily into the 
cage. It would have been pleas- 
ant to kiss those wonderful lips 
good-by. I’d thought about them 
for a whole month, wanting them 
and loathing them at the same 
time. 

It would have been like kissing 
a coral snake. I knew it and I 
concentrated on shutting the gate 
on her. 

“You’d like to be rich, wouldn’t 
you, Weldon?” she asked through 
the mesh. 

“I can be,” I said. “I have the 
machine. I can send people into

he past or future and make my- 
r If a pile . of dough. Only I’d 
:ve them food to take along. I 
wouldn’t kill them off to keep 
he secret to myself. Anything 
Ise on your mind?” 

"You want me,” she stated. 

I didn’t argue. 

“You could have me." 

“Just long enough to get my 
throat slit or brains blown out. 

I don’t want anything that 
much.” 

I rammed the switch closed. 

The mesh cage blurred and she 
was gone. Her blood was on the 
ioor, but she was gone into the 
: nture I had just come from. 

That was when the reaction 
tilt me. I’d escaped starvation 
and her gun, but I wasn’t a hero 
and the release of tension flipped 
ny stomach over and unhinged 
my knees. 

Shaking badly, I stumbled 
through the big, empty house 
until I found a phone. 

¥ OU PAPE got there so quickly 
that I still hadn’t gotten over 
the tremors, in spite of a bottle 
of bfandy I dug out of a credenza, 
maybe because the date on the 
label, 1763, . gave me a new case 
of the shivers. 

I could see the worry on Lou’s 
face vanish when he assured him- 
self that I was all right. It came 
back again, though, when I told 
him what had happened. He 



didn’t believe any of it, natural- 
ly. I guess I hadn’t really ex- 
pected him to. 

“If I didn't know you, Mark,” 
he said, shaking his big, dark 
head unhappily, “I’d send you 
over to Bellevue for observation. 
Even knowing you, maybe that’s 
what I ought to do.” 

“All right, let’s see if there’s 
any proof," I suggested tiredly. 
“From what I was told, there 
ought to be plenty,” 

We searched the house clear 
down to the basement, where he 
stood with his face slack. 

“Christ!” he breathed. “The 
annex to the Metropolitan Mu- 
seum!” 

The basement ran the length 
and breadth of the house and was 
twice as high as an average 
room, and the whole glittering 
place was crammed with paint- 
ings in rich, heavy frames, statu- 
ettes, books, manuscripts, goblets 
and ewers and jewelry made of 
gold and huge gems, and tapes- 
tries in brilliant color . and 
everything was as bright and 
sparkling and new as the day it 
was made, which was almost true 
of a lot of it. 

“The dame was loaded and she 
was an art collector, that’s all,” 
Lou said, “You can’t sell me that 
screwy story of yours. She was a 
collector and she knew where to 
find things.” 

“She certainly did,” I agreed. 



THE OLD DIE RICH 



53 



“What did you do with her?” 

“I told you. I shot her through 
the arm before she could shoot 
me and I sent her into the fu- 
ture.” 

He took me by the front of 
the jacket. “You killed her, Mark. 
You wanted all this stuff for 
yourself, so you knocked her off 
and got rid of her body some- 
how.” 

“Why don’t you go back to 
acting, where you belong, Lou, 
and leave sleuthing to people who 
know how?” I asked, too worn 
to pull his hands loose. “Would 
I kill her and call you up to get 
right over here? Wouldn’t I have 
sneaked these things out first? 
Or more likely I’d have sneaked 
them out, hidden them and no- 
body — including you — would 
know I’d ever been here. Come 

“That’s easy. You lost your 
on, use your head.” 
nerve.” 

“I’m not even losing my pa- 
tience.” 

* 

H E pushed me away savagely. 

“If you killed her for this 
stuff or because of that crazy 
yarn you gave me, I’m a cop and 
you’re no friend. You’re just a 
plain killer I happened to have 
known once, and I’ll make sure 
you fry.” 

“You always did have a taste 
for that kind of dialogue. Go 
ahead and wrap me up in an air- 



tight case, have them throw the 
book at me, send me up the 
river, put me in the hot squat. 
But you’ll have to do the proving, 
not me.” 

He headed for the stairs. “I 
will. And don’t try to make a 
break or I’ll plug you as if I 
never saw you before.” 

He put in a call at the phone 
upstairs. I didn’t give a par- 
ticular damn who it was he’d 
called. I was too relieved that I 
hadn’t killed May Roberts; de- 
stroying anything that beautiful, 
however evil, would have stayed 
with me the rest of my life. There 
was another reason for my relief 
— if I’d killed her and left the 
evidence for Lou to find, he’d 
never help me. No, that’s not 
quite so; he’d probably have 
tried to get me to plead insanity 
on the basis of my unbelievable 
explanation. 

But most of all, I couldn’t get 
rid of the look on her face when 
I’d shot her through the arm, 
the arm that was so wonderful to 
look at and that had held a 
murderous little gun to greet me 
with. * 

She was in the future now. She 
wouldn’t be executed by them; 
they regarded crime as an ill- 
ness, and they’d treat her with 
their marvelously advanced ther- 
apy and she’d become a useful, 
contented citizen, living out her 
existence in an era that had given

me more happiness than I’d ever 
had. 

I sat and tried to stupefy my - 
elf with brandy that should long 
i go have dried to brick-hardness, 
'/hile Lou Pape stood at the door 
vith his hand near his holster 
md glared at me. He didn’t take 

■ is eyes off me until somebody 

■ amed Prof. Jeremiah Aaronson 
ame in and was introduced brief- 
ly and flatly to me. Then Lou 
took him upstairs. 

It was minutes before I res- 
ized what they were going to 
!o. I ran up after them. 

I was just in time to see Aaron- 
.on carefully take the housing off 
the hooded motors, and leap back 

■ uddenly from the fury of light- 
ning sparks. 

r T'HE whole machine fused while 
we watched helplessly — mo- 
tors, switches, panel and mesh 
rage. They flashed blindingly and 
blew apart and melted together 
in a charred and molten pile, 

“Rigged,” Aaronson said in the 
tone of a bitter curse. “Set to 
short if it was tampered with. I 
wouldn’t be surprised if there 
were incendiaries placed at stra- 
tegic spots. Nothing else could 
have made a mess like this.” 

He finally glatjced down at his 
hand and saw it was scorched. 
He hissed with the realization of 
pain, blew on the burn, shook it 
in the air to cool it, and pulled 



a handkerchief out of his back 
pocket by reaching all the way 
around the rear for it with his 
left hand. 

Lou looked helplessly at the 
heap of cooling slag. “Can you 
make any sense of it, Prof?” he 
asked. 

“Can you?” Aaronson retorted. 
“Melt down a microtome or any 
other piece of machinery you’re 
unfamiliar with, and see if you 
can identify it when it looks 
like this.” 

He went out, wrapping his hand 
in the handkerchief. 

Lou kicked glumly at a piece 
of twisted tubing. “Aaronson is a 
top physicist, Mark. I was hoping 
he’d make enough out of the ma- 
chine to — ah, hell, I wanted to 
believe you! I couldn’t. I still 
can’t. Now we’ll have to dig 
tmough the house to find her 
body.” 

“You won’t find it or the secret 
of the machine,” I answered mis- 
erably. “I told you they said the 
secret would be lost. This is how. 
Now I’ll never be able to visit 
the future again. I’ll never see 
them or May Roberts. They’ll 
straighten her out, get rid of her 
hate and vindictiveness, and it 
won’t do me a damned bit of 
good because the machine is gone 
and she’s generations ahead of 
'me.” 

He turned to me puzzledly. 
“You’re not afraid to have us 



THE OLD DIE RICH

dig for her body, Mark?” 

“Tear the place apart if you 
want.” 

“We’ll have to,” he said. “I’m 
calling Homicide.” 

“Call in the Marines. Call in 
anybody you like.” 

“You’ll have to stay in my 
custody until we’re through.” 

I shrugged. “As long as you 
leave me alone while you’re do- 
ing your digging, I don’t give a 
hang if I’m under arrest for 
suspicion of murder. I’ve got to 
do some straightening out. I wish 
the people in the future could 
take on the job — they could do it 
faster and better than I can — but 
some nice, peaceful quiet would 
help.” 

H E didn’t touch me or say a 
word to me as we waited for 
the squad to arrive. I sat in the 
chair and shut out first him and 
then the men with their sound- 
ing hammers and crowbars and 
all the rest. 

She’d been ruthless and cal- 
lous, and she’d murdered old 
people with no more pity than 
a wolf among a herd of helpless 
sheep. 

But Blundell and Carr had told 
me that she was as much a victim 
as the oldsters who’d died of 
starvation with the riches she’d 
given them still untouched, on 
deposit in the banks or stuffed 
into hiding places or pinned to 



their shabby clothes. She needed 
treatment for the illness her fath- 
er had inflicted on her. But 
even he, they’d said, had been 
suffering from a severe emo- 
tional disturbance and proper 
care could have made a great 
and honored scientist out of him. 

They’d told me the truth and 
made me hate her, and they’d 
told me their viewpoint and made 
that hatred impossible. 

I was here, in the present, with- 
out her. The machine was gone. 
Yearning over something I 
couldn’t change would destroy 
me. I had no right to destroy 
myself. Nobody did, they’d told 
me, and nobody who reconciles 
himself to the fact that some 
situations just are impossible to 
work out ever could. 

I’d realized that when the 
squad packed up and left and 
Lou Pape came over to where I 
was sitting. 

“You knew we wouldn’t find 
her,” he said. 

“That’s what I kept telling 
you.” 

“Where is she?” 

- “In Port Said, exotic hellhole 
of the world, where she’s danc- 
ing in veils for the depraved — ” 

“Cut out the kidding! Where 
is she?” 

“What’s the difference, Lou? 
She’s not here, is she?” 

“That doesn’t mean she can’t 
be somewhere else, dead.”

“She’s not dead. You don’t 
have to believe me about any- 
thing else, just that” 

He hauled me out of the chair 
md stared hard at my face. 

You aren’t lying,” he said. “I 
know you well enough to know 
you’re not.” 

“All right, then.” 

“But you’re a damned fool to 
think a dish like that would have 
any part of you. I don’t mean 
you’re nothing a woman would 
go for, but she’s more fang than 
female. You’d have to be richer 
and better -looking than her, for 
>ne thing — ” 

“Not after my friends get 
through with her. She’ll know a 
good man when she sees one and 
I’d be what she wants.” I slid 
my hand over my naked scalp. 
“Witfi a head of hair, I’d look 
my real age, which happens to 
’>e a year younger than you, if 
you remember. She’d go for me — 
they checked our emotional quo- 
tients and we’d be a natural to- 
gether. The only thing was that 
I was bald. They could have 
grown hair on my head, which 
would have taken care of that, 
and then we’d have gotten to- 
gether like gin and tonic.” 

L OU arched his black eye- 
brows at me. “They really 
could grow hair on you?” 
“Sure. Now you want to know 
why I didn’t let them.” I glaneed 



out the window at the smoky 
city. “That’s why. They couldn’t 
tell me if I’d ever get back to 
the future. I wasn’t taking any 
chances. As long as there was a 
possibility that I’d be stranded 
in my own time, I wasn’t going to 
lose my livelihood. Which re- 
minds me, you have anything 
else to do here?” 

“There’ll be a guard stationed 
around the house and all her 
holdings and art will be taken 
ov$r until she comes back—” 
“She won’t.” 

“ — or is declared legally dead.” 
“And me?” I broke in. 

“We can’t hold you without 
proof of murder.” 

“Good enough. Then let’s get 
out of here.” 

“I have to go back on duty,” 
he objected. 

“Not any more. I’ve got over 
$15,000 in cash and deposits — 
enough to finance you and me.” 
“Enough to kill her for.” 
“Enough to finance you and 
me,” I repeated doggedly, “I told 
you I had the money before she 
sent me into the future—” 

“AH right, all right," he inter- 
rupted. “Let’s not go into that 
again. We couldn't find a body, 
so you’re free. Now what’s this 
about financing the two of us?” 
I put my fingers around his 
arm and steered him out to the 
street. 

“This city has never had a

worse cop than you,” I said. 
“Why? Because you’re an actor, 
not a cop. You’re going back to 
acting, Lou. This money will keep 
us both going until we get a 
break.” 

He gave me the slit -eyed look 
he’d picked up in line of duty, 
“That wouldn’t be a bribe, would 
'it?” 

“Call it a kind of memorial 
to a lot of poor, innocent old 
people and a sick, tormented 
woman.” 

We walked along in silence out 
in the clean sunshine. It was our 
silence; the sleek cars and burly 
trucks made their noise and the 
pedestrians added their gabble, 
but a good Stanislavsky actor 
like Lou wouldn’t notice that. 
Neither would I, ordinarily, but 
■I was giving him a chance to 
work his way through this situa- 
tion. 

“I won’t hand you a lie, Mark,” 
he said finally. “I never stopped 
wanting to act. I’ll take your 
deal on two considerations.” • 

“All right, what are they?” 

“That whatever I take off you 
is strictly a loan.” 

“No argument. What’s the 
other?” 

He had an unlit cigarette al- 



most to his lips. He held it there 
while he said: “That any time 
you come across a case of an old 
person who died of starvation 
with $30,000 stashed away some- 
where, you turn fast to the the- 
atrical page and not tell me or 
even think about it.”. 

“I don’t have to agree to that.” 

H E lowered the cigarette, stop- 
ped and turned to me. “You 
mean it’s no deal?” 

“Not that,” I said. “I mean 
there won’t be any more of those 
cases. Between knowing that and 
both of us back acting again. 
I’m satisfied. You don’t have to 
believe me. Nobody does." 

He lit up and blew out a 
pretty plume, fine and slow and 
straight, which would have tele- 
vized like a million in the bank. 
Then he grinned. “You wouldn’t 
want to bet on that, would you?” 
“Not with a friend. I do all 
my sure -thing betting with book- 
ies.” 

“Then make it a token bet,” i 
he said. “One buck that some- 
body dies of starvation with a 
big poke within a year.” 

I took the bet. 

I took the dollar a year later.

ends and impossibility begins!

R ONNY was playing by 
himself, which meant he 
was two tribes of Indians 
having a war. 

“Bang,” he muttered, firing an 
imaginary rifle. He decided that 
it was a time in history before 
the white people had sold the 
Indians any guns, and changed 
the rifle into a bow. “Wizz- 
thunk,” he substituted, mimick- 
ing from an Indian film on TV 
the graphic sound of an arrow 
striking flesh. 

“Oof.” He folded down onto the 
grass, moaning, “Uhhhooh . .” 



and relaxing into defeat and 
death. 

“Want some chocolate milk, 
Ronny?” asked his mother’s 
voice from the kitchen. 

“No, thanks,” he called back, 
climbing to his feet to be another 
man. “Wizzthunk, wizzthunk,” 
he added to the flights of arrows 
as the best archer in the tribe. 
“Last arrow. Wizzzz,” he said, 
missing one enemy for realism. 
He addressed another battling 
brave. “Who has more arrows? 
They are coming too close. No 
time — I’ll have to use my knife.”

He drew the imaginary knife, 
ducking an arrow as it shot close. 

fTVHEN he was the tribal chief 
standing somewhere else, and 
he saw that the warriors left 
alive were outnumbered. 

“We must retreat. We cannot 
leave our tribe without warriors 
to protect the women.” 

Ronny decided that the chief 
was heroically wounded, his voice 
wavering from weakness. He had 
been propping himself against a 
tree to appear unharmed, but 
now he moved so that his braves 
could see he was pinned to the 
trunk by an arrow and could not 
walk. They cried out. 

He said, “Leave me and escape. 
But remember . .” No words 
came, just the feeling of being 
what he was, a dying old eagle, 
a chief of warriors, speaking to 
young warriors who would need 
advice of seasoned humor and 
moderation to carry them through 
their young battles. He had tg 
finish the sentence, tell them 
something wise. 

Ronny tried harder, pulling the 
feeling around him like a cloak 
of resignation and pride, leaning 
indifferently against the tree 
where the arrow had pinned him, 
hearing dimly in anticipation the 
sound of his aged voice conquer- 
ing weakness to speak wisely of 
what they needed to be told. 
They had many battles ahead of 



them, and the battles would be 
against odds, with so many dead 
already. 

They must watch and wait, be 
flexible and tenacious, determined 
and persistent — but not too rash, 
subtle and indirect — not coward- 
ly, and above all be patient with 
the triumph of the enemy and 
not maddened into suicidal di- 
rect attack. 

His stomach hurt with the ar- 
row wound, and his braves wait- 
ed to hear his words. He had to 
sum a part of his life’s experi- 
ence in words. Ronny tried harder 
to build the scene realistically. 
Then suddenly it was real. He 
was the man. 

He was an old man, guide and 
adviser in an oblique battle 
against great otfcfs. He was dying 
of something and his stomach 
hurt with a knotted ache, like 
hunger, and he was thirsty. He 
had refused to let the young men 
make the sacrifice of trying to 
rescue him. He was hostage in 
the jail and dying, because he 
would not surrender to the enemy 
nor cease to fight them. He 
smiled and said, “Remember to 
live like other men, but — remem- 
ber to remember." 

And then he was saying things 
that could not be put into words, 
complex feelings that were ways 
of taking bad situations that 
made them easier to smile at, 
and then sentences that were not

entences, but single alphabet let- 
ters pushing each other ' with 
igns, with a feeling of being con- 
i iected like two halves of a swing, 
one side moving up when the 
other moved down, or like swings 
or like cogs and pendulums in- 
side a clock, only without the 
fogs, just with the push. 

It wasn’t adding or multipica- 
tion, and it used letters instead 
of numbers, but Ronny knew it 
was some kind of arithmetic. 

And he wasn’t Ronny. 

He was an old man, teaching 
young men, and the old man did 
oot know about Ronny. He 
thought sadly frdw little he 
would be able to convey to the 
young men, and he remembered 
more, trying to sum long mem- 
ories and much living into a few 
direct thoughts. And Ronny was 
the old man and himself, both at 
ince. 

t 

TT was too intense. Part of 
Ronny wanted to escape and 
tie alone, and that part withdrew 
and wanted to play something. 
Ronny feat in the grass and play- 
ed with his toes like a much 
younger child. 

Part of Ronny that was Doc- 
tor Revert Purcell sat on the 
edge of a prison cot, concentrat- 
ing on secret unpublished equa- 
tions of biogenic stability which 
he wanted to pass on to the 
responsible hands of young re- 



searchers in the concealed-re- 
search chain. He was using the 
way of thinking which they had 
told him was the telepathic send- 
ing of ideas to anyone ready to 
receive. It was odd that he him- 
self could never tell when he was 
sending. Probably a matter of 
age. They had started trying to 
teach him when he was already 
too old for anything so different. 

The water tap, four feet away, 
was dripping steadily, and it was 
hard for Purcell to concentrate, 
so intense was his thirst. He 
wondered if he could gather 
strength to walk that far. He was 
sitting up and that was good, but 
the struggle to raise himself that 
far had left him dizzy and trem- 
bling. If he tried to stand, the 
effort would surely interrupt his 
transmitting of equations and all 
the data he had not sent yet. 

Would the man with the keys 
who looked in the door twice a 
day care whether Purcell died 
with dignity? He was the only 
audience, and his expression 
never changed when Purcell ask- 
ed him to point out to the au- 
thorities that he was not being 
given anything to eat. It was 
funny to Purcell to find that he 
wanted the respect of any audi- 
ence to his dying, even of a man 
without response who treated 
him as if he were already a 
corpse. 

Perhaps the man would re-

spond if Purcell said, “I have 
changed my mind. I will tell.” 
But if he said that, he would 
lose his own respect. 

At the biochemists’ and bio- 
physicists’ convention, the re- 
porter had asked him if any, of 
his researches could be applied 
to warfare. 

He had answered with no feel- 
ing of danger, knowing that what 
he did was common practice 
among research men, sure that it 
was an unchallengeable right. 

“Some of them can, but those 
I keep to myself.” 

The reporter remained dead- 
pan. “For instance?” 

“Well, I have to choose some- 
thing that won’t reveal how it’s 
done now, but — ah — for example, 
a way of cheaply mass-producing 
specific antitoxins against any 
germ. It sounds harmless if you 
don’t think* about it, but actually 
it would make germ warfare the 
most deadly and inexpensive 
weapon yet developed, for it 
would make it possible to pre- 
vent the backspread of contagion 
into a country’s own troops, 
without much expense. There 
would be hell to pay if anyone 
ever let that out.” Then he had 
added, trying to get the reporter 
to understand enough to change 
his cynical unimpressed expres- 
sion, “You understand, germs 
are cheap — there would be £ new 
plague to spread everytime some 



pipsqueak biologist mutated a 
new germ. It isn’t even expensive 
or difficult, as atom bombs are.” 
The headline was: “Scientist 
Refuses to Give Secret of Wea- 
pon to Government.” 

G overnment men came 

and asked him if this was 
correct, and on having it con- 
firmed pointed out that he had 
an obligation. The research foun- 
dations where he had worked 
were subsidized by government 
money. He had been deferred 
from military service during his 
early years of study and work 
so he could become a scientist, 
instead of having to fight or die 
on the battlefield. 

“This might be so,” he had 
said. “I am making an attempt to 
serve mankind by doing as much 
good and as little damage as pos 
sible. If you don’t mind, I’d 
rather ,use my own judgment 
about what constitutes service.” 
The statement seemed too 
blunt the minute he had said it, 
and he recognized that it had 
implications that his judgment 
was superior to that of the gov- 
ernment. It probably was the 
most antagonizing thing that I 
could have been said, but he J 
could see no other possible state- ■ 
ment, for it represented precisely i 
what he thought. 

There were bigger headlines j 
about that interview, and when I

he stepped outside his building 
for lunch the next day, several 
small gangs of patriots arrived 
with the proclaimed purpose of 
pursuading him to tell. They 
fought each other for the privi- 
lege. 

The police had rescued him af- 
ter he had lost several front teeth 
and had one eye badly gouged. 
They then left him to the care 
of the prison doctor in protective 
custody. Two days later, after 
having been questioned several 
times on his attitude toward re- 
vealing the parts of his research 
he had kept secret, he was trans- 
ferred to a place that looked like 
a military jail, and left alone. He 
was not told what his status was. 

When someone came and asked 
him questions about his attitude, 
Purcell felt quite sure that what 
they were doing to him was ille- 
gal. He stated that he was going 
on a hunger strike until he was 
allowed to have visitors and see a 
lawyer. 

The next time the dinner hour^ 
arrived, they gave him nothing to 
eat. There had been no food in 
the cell since, and that was prob- 
ably two weeks ago. He was not 
sure just how long, for during 
part of the second week his mem- 
ory had become garbled. He dim- 
ly remembered ‘something that 
might have been delirium, which 
could have lasted more than one 
day. 



Perhaps the military who 
wanted the antitoxins . for germ 
warfare were waiting quietly for 
him either to talk or die. 

T>ONNY got lip from the grass 
and went into the kitchen, 
stumbling in his walk like a be- 
ginning toddler. 

“Choc -mil?” he said to his 
mother. 

She poured him some and 
teased gently, “What’s the mat- 
ter, Ronny — back to baby-talk?” 

He looked at her with big 
solemn eyes and drank slowly, 
not answering. 

In the cell somewhere distant. 
Dr. Purcell, famous biochemist, 
began waveringly trying fo rise 
to his feet, unable to remember 
hunger as anything separate from 
him that could ever be ended, 
but weakly wanting a glass of 
water. Ronny could not feed him 
with the chocolate milk. Even 
though this was another himself, 
the body that was drinking was 
not the one that was thirsty. 

He wandered out into the back 
yard again, carrying the glass. 

“Bang,” he said deceptively, 
pointing with his hand in case his 
mother was looking. "Bang.” 
Everything had to seem usual; he 
was sure of that. This was too 
big a thing, and too private, to 
tell a grownup. 

On the way back from the sink, 
Dr. Purcell slipped and fell and 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



li<t his head against the edge of 
the iron cot. Ronny felt the edge 
K-tshing through skin and into 
hone, and then a relaxing blank- 
ness inside his head, like falling 
sleep suddenly when they are 
Uing you a fairy story while 
vou want to stay awake to find 
out what happened next. 

"Bang,” said Ronny vaguely, 
pointing at a tree. “Bang.” He 
was ashamed because he had 
fallen down in the cell and hurt 
his head and become just Ronny 
;'ain before he had finished 
nding out his equations.- He 
ied to make believe he was alive 
igain, but it didn’t work. 

You could never make-believe 
anything to a real good finish. 
They never ended neatly — there 
was always something unfin- 
ished, and something that would 
t;o right on after the end. 

It would have been nice if the 
i ailers had come in and he had 
been able to say something noble 
to them before dying, to show 
that he was brave. 

“Bang,” he said randomly, 
ointing his finger at his head, 
nd then jerked his hand away 
is if it had burned him. He had 
become the wrong person that 
time. The feel of a bullet jolting 
the side of his head was startling 
and unpleasant, even if not real, 
and the flash of someone’s vin- 
dictive anger and self-pity while 
pulling a trigger . , My wife 



will be sorry she ever . He 
didn’t* like that kind of make-be- 
lieve. It felt unsafe to do it with- 
out making up a story first. 

Ronny decided to be Indian 
braves again. They weren’t very 
real, and when they were, they 
had simple straightforward emo- 
tions about courage and skill and 
pride and friendship that he 
would like. 

A MAN was leaning his arms 
on the fence, watching him. 
“Nice day.” What’s the matter, 
kid, are you an esper? 

“Hul-lo,” Ronny stood on one 
foot and watched him. Just mak- 
ing believe. I only want to play. 
They make it too serious, having 
all these troubles. 

“Good countryside,” The man 
gestured at the back yards, all 
opened in together with tangled 
bushes here and there to crouch 
behind, when other kids were 
there to play hide and seek, and 
with trees to climb. It can be the 
Universe if you pick and choose 
who to be, and don't let wrong 
choices make you shut off from 
it. You can make yourself learn 
from this if you are strong 
enough. Who have you been? 

Ronny stood on the other foot 
and scratched the back of his 
leg with his toes. He didn’t want 
to remember. He always forgot 
right away, but this grownup 
was confident and young and

65 



strong -looking, and meant some- 
thing when he talked, not like 
most grownups. 

“I was playing Indian.” I was 
an old chief, captured by ene- 
mies, trying to pass on to other 
warriors the wisdom of my life 
before I died. He made believe 
he "Was the chief a little to show 
the young man what he was talk- 
ing about. 

“Purcell!” The man drew in 
his breath between his teeth, and 
his face paled. He pulled back 
from reaching Ronny with his 
feelings, like holding his breath 
in. “Good game.” You can /e^rn 
from him. Don’t leave him shut 
off, I beg you. You can let him 
influence you without being 
pulled off your own course. He 
was a good man. You were hon- 
ored, and 1 envy the man you 
wilt be if you contacted him on 
resonant similarities. 

The grownup looked fright- 
ened. But you are too young. 
You'll block him out and lose 
him. Kids have to grow and leart 1 
at their own speed. 

Then he looked less afraid, but 
uncertain, and his thoughts strug- 
gled against each other. Their 
own speed. But there should be 
someone alive with PurcelFs 
pattern and memories. We loved 
him. Kids should grow at their 
own speed, but . How strong 
are you, Ronny? Can you move 
ahead of the normal growth pat- 



tern? 

Grownups always want you to 
do something. Ronny stared back, 
clenching his hands and moving 
his feet uneasily. 

The thoughts were open to him 
Do you want to be the old chief 
again, Ronny? Be him often, so 
you can learn to know what he 
knew? ( And feel as he felt. It 
would be a stiff dose tor a kid. | 

It will be rich and exciting, full of 
memories and skills. (Rut hard . 
to chew. I’m doing this for Pur 
cell, Ronny, not for you. You j, 
have to make up your own mind ) 

“That was a good game. Are 
you going to play it any more?” 

H IS mother would not like it. 

She would feel the difference 
in him, as much as if he had 
read one of the books she kept 
away from him, books that were 
supposed to be for adults only. 
The difference would hurt her. 
He was being bad, like eating 
between meals. But to know , 
what grownups knew. 

He tightened his fists and; 
looked down at the grass. “I’llj 
play it some more.” 

The young man smiled, still 
pale and holding half his feelings 
back behind a dam. Then mesh 
with me a moment. Let me in. 

He was in with the thought, 
feeling Ronny’s confused con- 
sent, reassuring him by not think-? 
ing or looking around inside while

■ riding out a single call, Pur- 
• f II, Doc, that found the combi- 
nation key to Ronny’s guarded 
yesterdays and last nights and

hut feel like this about it — and 
lie planted in a strong set, ques- 
tioning, cool, open, a feeling of 
tbsorbing without words ... it 
will give information when you 
need it, like a dictionary. 

The grownup straightened 
,iway from the fence, preparing 
to walk off. Behind a dam 
pressed grief and anger for the 
leath of the man he called Pur* 
ell. 

“And any time you want to be 
t he old chief, at any age he lived, 
rust make believe you are him.” 

Grief and anger pressed more 
trongly against the dam, and 
the man turned and left rapidly, 
letting his thoughts flicker and 
scatter through private memories 
that Ronny did not share, that 
no one shared, breaking thought 
contact with everyone so that the 



man could be alone in his own 
mind to have his feelings in pri- 
vate. 

¥>ONNY picked up the empty 
glass that had held his 
chocolate, milk from the back 
steps where he had left it and 
went inside. As he stepped into 
the kitchen, he knew what an- 
other kitchen had looked like for 
a fiye-year-old child who had 
been Purcell ninety years ago. 
There had been an iron sink, and 
a brown- and -green-spotted fau- 
cet, and the glass had been 
heavier and transparent, like 
real glass. 

Ronny reached up and put the 
colored plastic tumbler down, 
“That was a nice young man, 
dear. What did he say to you?” 
Ronny looked up at his mam- 
ma, comparing her with the 
remembered mamma of fifty 
years ago. He loved the other 
one, too. 

“He tol’ me he’s glad I play 
Indian.”

TUATARA 



the world and possibly without 
success. 

For the first time in many dec- 
ades, the New Zealand govern- 
ment has permitted the export 
for exhibition of four Tuataras, 
(Hatterias or Sphenodons; in 
short, rhynchocephalia) . 

What do they look like? Well, 
like lizards, more or less dirty 
green in color, with an unusually 
large head and unusually large 
bright eyes in that head. Adult 
specimens are about 18 inches 
long. The ones on exhibit in the 
zoological gardens of the cities 
mentioned are young specimens 
which have not yet attained their 
full size. But they do have the 
spiny crest along back and tail 
which is the reason for the name 
Tuatara, a Maori word which 
can be translated as “spine- 
bearer.” 

It should be abundantly clear 
by now, because of the mention 
of the New Zealand government 



and the Maori name of the little 
creature, that its home is in New 
Zealand. But no longer New 
Zealand generally. 

Only a few hundred years ago, 
the Tuatara, it is believed, lived 
on both the main islands of New 
Zealand. The Maoris who came 
there from their original home 
islands of the Southern Pacific — 
they call their original home Ha- 
waiki, but it was not the Hawaii 
of our maps — did not bother the 
small lizard much. Nor did the 
white settlers of a hundred and 
fifty years ago. 

But the white settlers brought 
animals with them — dogs, cats 
and pigs, all three destructive to 
life-forms such as the Tuatara. 
The pigs especially, with their 
habit of rummaging through un- 
derbrush and eating everything 
that isn’t wood or stone, exter- 
minated the Tuatara on the main 
islands, by eating lizards and 
eggs alike. All this happened 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



69 




without the settlers being even 
aware of what went on, which is 
the main reason why so much of 
this article is conjecture. 

I INCLINE to the belief that 
Tuatara, if it had ever been 
abundant on the South Island, 
would still be there. There are 
still large unsettled and virtually 
unexplored areas on the South 
Island, as the recent rediscovery 
of the bird Takahe ( Notornis ) 
has demonstrated. 

At any event, if you want to 
find the present home of Tuatara 
on a map, you need a pretty good 
map. The North and South Is- 
lands of New Zealand are sepa- 
rated by Cook Strait. West of 
Cook Strait, due north of the 
South Island, there is a smaller 
island named D’Urville Island, 
which is still indicated on most 
maps. Due north ot D’Urville 
Island there is a small rocky islet 
called Stephen Island, rarely seen 



on any map. But it is Tuatara’s 
home, or rather one of them, for 
the little saurian also occurs on 
a few other rocky islands along 
the New Zealand coast, all strict- 
ly protected. 

When at home, Tuatara, slow- 
moving and cold-loving, eats in- 
sects, small crustaceans and 
other lizards, provided they are 
small enough. In captivity the 
diet is usually earthworms, but 
some have taken fish. The fact 
that they do eat fish, even though 
rarely, may explain why the Tua- 
taras, very long ago, decided to 
set up community housekeeping 
with birds, — “dovey petrels,” to 
be precise. These marine birds 
nest in burrows which they dig, 
but the Tuataras move in on 
them. Whether the Tuataras 
elaborated upon the burrows or 
the petrels obligingly did it for 
them (as is generally assumed) 
is not completely known. But 
there is a double nest at the bot- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tom; the petrels occupy the dug- 
out to the left and the Tuataras 
the one to the right of the en- 
trance. 

It was comparatively easy to 
tell that Tuatara (the scientific 
names, as has been mentioned, 
ire Hatteria or Sphenodoii) is 
very rare. There was no problem 
n reporting where and how they 
live. But when it comes to the 
question of why zoologists and 
paleontologists grow dreamy- 
eyed at the very mention of the 
name, I don’t have a one-sen- 
tence answer. 

T ET me try to explain it chron- 
^ ologically. Tuatara became 
known to science about 1830. An 
explorer by the name of Dieffen- 
bach reported on its existence in 
i German journal. The main rea- 
son why his report is still re- 
membered is that he gave the 
name Ngarara as the Maori 
name; all others reported the na- 
tive name as Tuatara, Tuatera, 
Ruatara, or Tuatete — obviously 
the same word with slightly dif- 
fering pronunciations. 

Four years before Dieffenbach. 
a British scientist, Edward Gray, 
had published a Note on a Pe- 
culiar Structure in the Head of 
an Agama. «, 

Of course, Tuatara is not an 
Agama lizard; but the report on 
the strange organ in its head 
caused some comment, and an 



anatomist by the name of Gun- 
ther went to work, delicately and 
diligently. Finally he could an- 
nounce that the “structure" itself 
was not so peculiar, only its loca- 
tion on top of the head. 

It was a third eye! 

This was enough to give pa- 
leontologists vivid professional 
dreams. Once upon a time, during 
the Triassic period, some 175 mil- 
lion years ago, three- eyed reptiles 
were no rarity. But few of them f 
had survived even to the end of 
the Triassic Period. 

Here was one with that feature, 
still alive. 

Apparently the third eye had 
somewhat reduced its size and 
activity in the course of time. It 
is smaller than the other two and 
is protected by a large transpar- 
ent scale which is “set" in a circle 
of small opaque scales. But it is 
a complete eye in structure. Its 
connecting optical nerve is in 
working order and the whole is 
sensitive at least to light and 
dark. (Only the large black sea- 
weed-eating iguana of the Gala- 
pagos Islands also has a still 
sensitive third eye, but it is far 
less well-preserved than that of 
Hatteria.') 

The third or “pineal” eye alone 
proved that Tuatara was old. 
How old was established by care- 
ful, millimeter by millimeter ex- 
amination of each of its features. 
Tuatara turned out to be the last

surviving member of a group of 
reptiles which bear the scientific 
label of rynchocephalians (“beak- 
heads”). The group was going 
strong during the Triassic Pe- 
riod. During the following period, 
the Jurassic, they spread consid- 
erably, but became less numerous 
at the same time. 

One of these Jurassic ryncho- 
cephalians of 145 million years 
ago, Homoesaurus, looked and 
was so much like Tuatara that 
it would be hard to tell the two 
apart if both were still alive. The 
remains of Homoesaurus have 
been found in England and in 
Bavaria, but representatives of 
that type had reached Malaya 
and New Guinea at just about 
that time. 

There was then a land bridge 
from New Guinea to New Zea- 
land’s North Island via New Cal- 
edonia. This is how Tuatara got 
to New Zealand. Some time af- 
terward, that land bridge broke 
up into widely separated islands. 
Tuatara was in a place where it 
was safe, with nothing to bother 
it, until the settlers introduced 
pigs. 

Occasionally you can read in a 
popular book or article that 
Tuatara is a surviving small di- 
nosaur. 

That is not so! The dinosaurs 
came later. 

Tuatara is one of the ancestors 
of the dinosaurs. 



THOSE CLUMSY STEPS 

R OUGHLY three times every 
month I receive a letter in 
which I am informed that all 
space travel men lack imagina- 
tion. Just because they have dis- 
covered that a rocket is the only 
known means for accelerating and 
decelerating in the vacuum of 
space, they want to use rockets 
for everything. And because they 
can’t imagine anything else any 
more but liquid fuel rockets, they 
build rocket ships consisting of 
three stages, the two lower steps 
exclusively designed to boost the 
top stage up to the desired speed. 
Of course, the step below the 
third has to be much heavier 
and larger, and the bottom step, 
which has to lift all the others 
off the ground, must be the big- 
gest and clumsiest of them all. 

But, the reasoning runs, we 
only have to get the top stage up 
to proper speed. There is no need 
for the lower stages to develop a 
lot of speed, especially since they 
are supposed to fall back, any- 
way. Why not use a catapultlike 
or gunlike device to put some ini- 
tial speed behind the top stage? 
The whole job would be much 
easier and it probably would take 
less fuel, too. 

It almost sounds convincing. 
Or, rather, it may sound convinc- 
ing to those who have never 
tackled the job.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Let’s look at an actual exam- 
ple. There was that two-stage 
shot which carried to 250 miles. 
The upper stage was a WAC 
Corporal rocket. The lower stage 
was a V-2 rocket, which provided 
:ie upper stage with a velocity 
■ if almost precisely one mile per 
second at an altitude of 20 miles. 

If we want to send a WAC Cor- 
poral to 250 miles without a lower 
stage, we then have to supply one 
mile per second by means of a 
catapult or a gun. In fact, we 
may have to supply a little more 
than one mile per second, because 
the catapult obviously would not 
he 20 miles tall and would there - 
ore release the WAC Corporal 
it a lower altitude, where the air 
s denser Ind offers more resist - 
nce. The “muzzle velocity” 
■'ould have to be 7000 feet per 
econd. 

The acceleration the rocket 
would receive in the catapult is 
given by the formula 




where a is the acceleration, s is 
the length of the catapult or the 
gun and v is the velocity at the 
end of the catapult — those 7000 
feet per second, squared. 

Just try it a few times with 
various sets of figures and you’ll 
be convinced that it is not lack 
of imagination that makes the 
space travel scientists stick to 
multiple stages. Even if you aim 



for as low a “muzzle velocity” 
as 2500 ft./sec., you’ll find that 
you either need a catapult of im- 
possible length or else that the 
rocket would have to sustain ac- 
celerations as high as several 
hundred g. If you tried the latter, 
you would require a very massive 
rocket — let’s not even mention 
pilot and passengers — so that it 
emerges in one piece and in 
workable condition. Unfortunate- 
ly, it would then also have a very 
poor mass-ratio. 

Even with a mile-long shaft — 
one drilled, say, into the top of a 
mountain — the accelerations 
would still be too high for hu- 
man occupants, in spite of the 
fact that humans can stand much 
higher accelerations than was be- 
lieved possible as recently as 
eight years ago. And a tube one 
mile long, whether it is a vertical 
shaft in a mountain or a near- 
vertical structure up a steep 
mountain slope, will cost large 
sums of money. 

What you really need, though, 
is an acceleration path 20 or 30 
miles long; more in some cases. 
And the cheapest way to accom- 
plish that is by means of lower 
stages. 

—WILLY LEY 
ANY QUESTIONS? 

My son suggested that you 
might be able to answer my ques- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 




tion: “ Why is there no frost on 
cloudy nights?” I have known 
this fact for years, but no one 
seems to be able to tell me why. 

Mrs. Mary Coulson 
RR 2, Box 65 
Silver Lake, Indiana 
The statement that there is 
no frost on cloudy night is 
generally correct; in fact, there 
is a proverb which says “clear 
Moon, frost soon,'” indicating 
the same observation. The ex- 
planation is mostly provided by 
the fact that the air near the 
ground is mostly heated by the 
ground. In other words, the 
Sun does not heat the bottom 
layers of the air to any appre- 
ciable extent directly. It heats 
the ground, which passes the 
heat on -by re-radiation. If, af- 
ter a clear day, the night is 
clear, too, the heat is radiated 
into space. But if a cloud blan- 
ket forms at sunset, it acts like 
a real blanket, trapping the 
heat between ground and cloud 
layer. 

There is one condition where 
you may have frost in spite of 
an overcast sky. This happens 
if the weather has been quite 
cold — around 15° Fahrenheit, 
for some time; usually the sky 
is clear, or almost so, in such 
weather. Then, if a warm and 
- moist air mass moves in, it may 
not displace the cold air mass, 
but ride on top of it. Where the 



moist warm air touches the cold 
air, the moisture will condense, 
forming a cloud blanket which 
keeps the Sun’s rays out. The 
result is a series of cold days 
with an overcast sky. 

Why does water expand when 
it is cooled below its freezing 
point? 

Stephen Obrecht 

2109 Glenway Drive S.E. 

Cedar Rapids, Iowa 

Water reaches its greatest 
density not at its freezing point, 
but somewhat above the freez- 
ing point, at 4° centigrade. It 
freezes at 0° centigrade. Above 
and below 4° centigrade, it has 
a lesser density, than at that 
critical temperature. 

This is of great biological 
importance. If water below zero 
centigrade — ice — were heavier 
than liquid water, all ice that 
forms would sink to the bottom 
of rivers and lakes. During a 
Jong and severe winter, the 
lakes and most rivers would be 
solidly filled with ice from the 
bottom up, presumably destroy- 
ing many life-forms in the proc- 
ess. Since the ice floats on top, 
it forms an insulating layer, 
keeping the water below liquid 
so that aquatic life-forms can 
survive. 

Some time ago I heard that if 
a person stays in a completely 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



darkened room long enough to 
allow his irises to open complete- 
ly, he'll be able to see by so- 
called ' "black" or ultraviolet 
light, but that every object he 
sees will seem to be displaced a 
certain angular distance from its 
actual position. Can you shed 
any light ( black or otherwise ) on 
this? 

Bert Aver a 

Box 345 

Fairhope, Alabama 

It is not true that everybody 
van see ultra-violet after he has 
I teen in the dark long enough 
for his eyes to attain maximum 
sensitivity. It is true that' some 
people can see ultra-violet and 
they don’t even have to stay in 
a dark room — the main point 
is here that the intensity of or- 
dinarily visible light must he 
low enough so that the u-v is 
not “drowned out” completely. 
The ability to see u-v seems to 
be restricted to light-eyed peo- 
ple who are still fairly young; 
the ability seems to be lost with 
age. I don’t know whether an 
age limit has been actually es- 
tablished. As a rule of thumb, 
a person over 30 years of age 
is too old for that. 

But the idea of an angular 
displacement is wrong. Every- 
body can “see” ultra-violet via 
his camera. If there were sufcli 
a displacement, all pictures 
taken in light with much u-v in 



it (sunlight,* for example) 
would be fuzzy or have double 
outlines. I admit having seen 
photographs with fuzzy or dou- 
ble outlines, but the u-v had 
nothing to do with that. 

I have read that the Northern 
Lights are caused by Sun spots. 
If so, why are they seen only in 
the north? Would they be seen 
on other planets? 

Mildred Moore 
116 William Street 
Hightstown, N. J. 

The Northern Lights are 
caused by solar activity (Sun 
spots), but they are not restrict- 
ed to the north. They appear 
in the regions of the magnetic 
poles, which are reasonably 
close to the geographical poles. 
Scientific terminology is aurora 
borealis for those near the geo- 
graphical North Pole and au- 
rora australis for those near 
the geographical South Pole. 

The second portion of the 
question is especially interest- 
ing; it would he nice if we could 
be sure. To the best of my 
knowledge, no aurora has ever 
been seen in the Martian at- 
mosphere, but quite a number 
of astronomers believe that au- 
rorae may have been seen in 
the Venusian atmosphere. Ve- 
nus, going around the Sun in- 
side the orbit of Earth, shows 
decided phases like the Moon.

It happens that f#r more of the 
sickle points is visible than can 
be accounted for geometrically. 
Also, the outline of the sickle 
is sometimes “bumpy.” These 
irregularities do not necessarily 
have to be caused by aurorae, 
but they may be. 

7n the July 1951 issue of the 
American Scientist , George Ga- 
mow writes: “Recently this theo- 
retical conclusion ( Weizsacker , 
Kuiper et. a/.) found confirma- 
tion in the actual discovery of 
planetary systems near two close 
stars. Please explain. 

Joe Low 
620 Holland 
Lakewood, Colo. 

When you ask me to explain 
Dr. Gamow’e statement, I take 
it that you are looking for con- 
firmation of his assertion that 
planets of other stars are 
known. They are. To phrase it 
as carefully as possible, one has 
to say that star systems com- 
paratively near in space to our 
own sun are known to have non- 
luminous companions of plane- 
tary mass. They have not been 
seen so far — their existence is 
known because they influence 
the movement of their suns, 
which we can measure. 

The sUns in question are bi- 



naries or double stars, two suns 
moving around their common 
center of gravity. Once this mo- 
tion has been established, we 
are able to predict the relative 
positions accurately. But by 
careful study of photographs 
taken over a number of years, 
it turned out that the positions 
did not check precisely. There 
had to be at least one more 
body, not registering on the 
plates, to account for this. 

Several such suspicious cases 
had been under investigation 
for some years when K. Aa. 
Strand of Sproul Observatory 
(Swarthmore College) an- 
nounced in 1942 that the dou- 
ble star 61 in Cygnus had a 
companion of planetary mass, 
16 times as massive as Jupiter 
and moving around its sun 
once in 4.9 years. 

Only a few months later, the 
Leander McCormick Observa- 
tory of the University of Vir- 
ginia announced a similar dark 
companion of the system 70 in 
Ophiuchus. The period of this 
object is 17 years and its mass 
10.5 times that of Jupiter. 

Naturally, only very large 
dark companions can be found 
by this method. But it is logical 
to expect smaller planets where 
there are large ones.

Illustrated by ASHMAN 

T HE first morning that they 
were fillly committed to 
the planet, the executive 
officer stepped out of the ship. 

It was not quite dawn. Executive 
Hafner squinted in the early light ; 
his eyes opened wider, and he 
promptly went back inside. Three 
minutes later, he reappeared with 
the biologist in tow. 

“Last night you said there was 
nothing dangerous,” said the ex- 
ecutive. “Do you still think it’s 
so?” 

Dano Marin stared. “I do.” 
What his voice lacked in con- 



viction, it made up in embarrass- 
ment. He laughed uncertainly. 

“This is no laughing matter. 
I’ll talk to you later.” 

The biologist stood by the ship 
and watched as the executive 
walked to the row of sleeping 
colonists. 

“Mrs. Athyl,” said the execu- 
tive as he stopped beside the 
sleeping figure. 

She yawned, rubbed her eyes, 
rolled over, and stood up. The 
covering that should have been 
there, however, wasn’t. Neither 
was the garment she had on when 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




she had gone to sleep. She as- 
sumed the conventional position 
of a woman who is astonished 
to find herself unclad without 
her knowledge or consent. 

“It’s all right, Mrs. Athyl. 
I’m not a voyeur myself. Still, 
I think you should get some cloth- 
ing on.” Most of the colonists 
were awake now. Executive Haf- 
ner turned to them. “If you 
haven’t any suitable clothing in 
the ship, the commissary will 
issue you some. Explanations will 
be given later.” 

The colonists scattered. There 
was no compulsive modesty 
among them, for it couldn’t have 
survived a year and a half in 
crowded spaceships. Neverthe- 
less, it was a shock to awaken 
with no clothing on and not 
know who or what had removed 



it during the night. It was sur- 
prise more than anything else 
that disconcerted them. 

On his way back to the space- 
ship, Executive Hafner paused. 
“Any ideas about it?” 

Dano Marin shrugged. “How 
could I have? The planet is as 
new to me as it is to you.” 
“Sure. But you’re the biolo- 
gist.” 

As the only scientist in a crew 
of rough-and-ready colonists and 
builders, Marin was going to be 
called on to answer a lot of ques- 
tions that weren’t in his field. 

“Nocturnal insects, most like- 
ly,” he suggested. That was pretty 
weak, though he knew that in 
ancient times locusts had stripped 
fields in a matter of hours. Could 
they do the same with the cloth- 
ing of humans and not awaken

79 



them? “I’ll look into the matter. 
As soon as I find anything, I’ll 
let you know.” 

“Good.” Hafner nodded and 
went into the spaceship. 

"TVANO MARIN walked to the 
grove in which the colonists 
had been sleeping. It had been a 
mistake to let them bed down 
there, but at the time the re- 
quest had been made, there had 
seemed no reason not to grant it. 
After eighteen months in crowd- 
ed ships everyone naturally 
wanted fresh air and the rustle 
of leaves overhead. 

Marin looked out through the 
grove. It was empty now; the 
colonists, both men and women, 
had disappeared inside the ship, 
dressing, probably. 

The trees were not tall and 
the leaves were dark bottle-green. 
Occasional huge white flowers 
caught sunlight that made them 
seem larger than they were. It 
wasn’t Earth and therefore the 
trees couldn’t be magnolias. But 
they reminded Marin of magnolia 
trees and thereafter he always 
thought of them as that. 

The problem of the missing 
clothing was ironic. Biological 
Survey never made a mistake — 
yet obviously they had. They 
listed the planet as' the most suit- 
able for Man of any so far 
discovered. Few insects, no dan- 
gerous animals, a most equitable 



climate. They had named it 
Glade because that was the word 
which fitted best. The whole land 
mass seemed to be one vast and 
pleasant meadow. 

Evidently there were things 
about the planet that Biological 
Survey had missed. 

Marin dropped to his knees and 
began to look for clues. If in- 
sects had been responsible, there 
ought to be a few dead ones, 
crushed, perhaps, as the colon- 
ists rolled over in their sleep. 
There were no insects, either live 
or dead. 

He stood up in disappointment 
and walked slowly through the 
grove. It might be the trees. At 
night they could exude a vapor 
which was capable of dissolving 
the material from which the 
clothing had been made. Far- 
fetched, but not impossible. He 
crumbled a leaf in his hand and 
rubbed it against his sleeve. A 
pungent smell, but nothing hap- 
pened. That didn’t disprove the 
theory, of course. 

He looked out through the trees 
at the blue sun. It was bigger 
than Sol, but farther away. At 
Glade, it was about equal to 
the Sun on Earth. 

He almost missed the bright 
eyes that regarded him from the 
underbrush. Almost, but didn’t 
— the domain of biology begins 
at the edge of the atmosphere; 
it includes the brush and the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



80 



small creatures that live in it. 

He swooped down on it. The 
creature fled squealing. He ran it 
down in the grass outside the 
grove. It collapsed into quaking 
flesh as he picked it up. He 
talked to it gently and the terror 
subsided. 

It nibbled contentedly on his 
jacket as he carried it back to the 
ship. 

E XECUTIVE Hafner stared" 
unhappily into the cage. It 
was an undistinguished animal, 



small and something like an un- 
developed rodent. Its fur was 
sparse and stringy, unglamorous; 
it would never be an item in the 
fur export trade. 

“Can we exterminate it?” gsked 
Hafner. “Locally, that is.” 

“Hardly. It’s ecologically 
basic.” 

The executive looked blank. 
Dano Marin added the explana- 
tion: “You know how Biological 
Control works. As soon as a 
planet has been discovered that 
looks suitable, they send out a 




survey ship loaded with equip- 
ment. The ship flies low over a 
good part of the planet and the 
instruments in the ship record 
the neural currents of the animals 
below. The instruments can dis- 
tinguish the characteristic neural 
patterns of anything that has a 
brain, including insects. 

“Anyway, they have a pretty 
good idea of the kinds of animals 
on the planet and their relative 
distribution. Naturally, the sur- 
vey party takes a few specimens. 
They have to in order to correlate 
the pattern with the actual ani- 
mal, otherwise the neural pattern 
would be merely a meaningless 
squiggle on a microfilm. 

“The survey shows that this 
animal is one of only four species 
of mammals on the planet. It is 
also the most numerous.” 

Hafner grunted. “So if we kill 
them off here, others will swarm 
in from surrounding areas?” 
“That’s about it. There are 
probably millions of them on 
this peninsula. Of course, if you 
want to put a barrier across the 
narrow connection to the main- 
land, you might be able to wipe 
them out locally.” 

The executive scowled. A bar- 
rier was possible, but it would 
involve more work than he cared 
to expend. 

“What do they eat?” he asked 
truculently. 

“A little bit of everything, 



apparently. Insects, fruits, ber- 
ries, nuts, succulents, and grain.” 
Dano Marin smiled. “I guess it 
could be called an omnivore — 
now that our clothing is handy, it 
eats that, too.” 

Hafner didn’t smile. “I thought 
our clothing was supposed to be 
verminproof.” 

Marin shrugged. “It is, on 
twenty-seven planets. On the 
twenty-eighth, we meet up with 
a little fella that has better di- 
gestive fluids, that’s all.” 

Hafner looked pained. “Are 
they likely to bother the crops 
we plant?” 

“Offhand, I would say they 
aren’t. But then I would have said 
the same about our clothing.” 

Hafner made up his mind. “All 
right. You worry about the crops. 
Find some way to keep them out 
of the fields. Meanwhile, every- 
one sleeps in the ship until we can 
build dormitories.” 

Individual dwelling units would 
have been more appropriate in 
the colony at this stage, thought 
Marin. But it wasn’t for him to 
decide. The executive was a man 
who regarded a schedule as some- 
thing* to be exceeded. 

“The omnivore — ” began Mar- 
in. 

Hafner nodded impatiently. 
“Work on it,” he said, and walked 
away. 

The biologist sighed. The om- 
nivore really was a queer little 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



creature, but it was by no means 
the most important thing on 
Glade. For instance, why were 
there so few species of land ani- 
mals on the planet? No reptiles, 
numerous birds, and only four 
kinds of mammals. 

Every comparable planet teem- 
ed with a wild variety of life. 
Glade, in spite of seemingly ideal 
conditions, hadn’t developed. 
Why? 

He had asked Biological Con- 
trols for this assignment because 
it had seemed an interesting 
problem. Now, apparently, he 
was being pressed into service as 
an exterminator. 

He reached in the cage and 
picked up the omnivore. Mam- 
mals on Glade were not unex- 
pected. Parallel development 
took care of that. Given roughly 
the same kind of environment, 
similar animals would usually 
evolve. 

In the Late Carboniferous for- 
est on Earth, there had been 
creatures ^ike the omnivore, the 
primitive mammal from which 
all others had evolved. On Glade,' 
that kind of evolution just hadn’t 
taken place. What had kept na- 
ture from exploiting its evolu- 
tionary potentialities? There was 
the real problem, not how to wipe 
them out. 

Marin stuck a needle in the 
omnivore. It squealed and then 
relaxed. He drew out the blood 



and set it back in the cage. He 
could learn a lot about the ani- 
mal from trying to kill it. 

T HE quartermaster was shout- 
ing, though his normal voice 
carried quite well. 

“How do you know it’s mice?” 
the biologist asked him. 

“Look,” said the quartermaster 
angrily. 

Marin looked. The evidence did 
indicate mice. 

Before he could speak, the 
quartermaster snapped, “Don’t 
tell me they’re only micelike 
creatures. I know that. The ques- 
tion is: how can I get rid of 
them?” 

“Have you tried poison?” 

“Tell me what poison to use 
and I’ll use it.” 

It wasn’t the easiest question 
to answer. What was poisonous 
to an animal he had never seen 
and knew nothing about? Ac- 
cording to Biological Survey, 
the animal didn’t exist. 

It was unexpectedly serious. 
The colony could live off the 
land, and was expected to. But 
another group of colonists was 
due in three years. The colony 
was supposed to accumulate a 
surplus of food to feed the in- 
creased numbers. If they couldn’t 
store the food they grew any bet- 
ter than the concentrates, that 
surplus was going be scanty. 
Marin went over the ware-

house thoroughly. It was the 
usual early construction on a 
colonial world. Not esthetic, it 
was sturdy enough. Fused dirt 
floor, reinforced foot-thick walls, 
a ceiling slab of the same. The 
whole was bound together with a 
molecular cement that made it 
practically airtight. It had no 
windows; there were two doors. 
Certainly it should keep out ro- 
dents. 

A closer examination revealed 
an unexpected flaw. The floor was 
as hard as glass; no animal could 
gnaw through it, but, like glass, 
it was also brittle. The crew that 
had built the warehouse had evi- 
dently been in such a hurry to 
get back to Earth that they hadn’t 
been as careful as they should 
have been, for here and there the 
floor was thin. Somewhere under 
the heavy equipment piled on it, 
the floor had cracked. There a 
burrowing animal had means of 
entry. 

Short .of building another ware- 
house, it was too late to do 
anything about that. Micelike 
animals were inside and had to be 
controlled where they were. 

The biologist straightened up. 
“Catch me a few of them alive 
and I’ll see what I can do.” 

I N the morning, a dozen live 
specimens were delivered to 
the lab. They actually did re- 
semble mice. 



Their reactions were puzzling. 

No two of them were affected by 
the same poison. A compound 
that stiffened one in a matter of 
minutes left the others hale and 
hearty, and the poison he had 
developed to control the om- 
nivores was completely ineffec- < 
tive. 

The depredations in the ware- ; 
house went on. Black mice, white 
ones, gray and brown, short- \ 
tailed and long-eared, or the re- j 
verse, they continued to eat the j 
concentrates and spoil what they j 
didn’t eat. 1 

Marin conferred with the ex- 
ecutive, outlined the problem as 
he saw it and his ideas on what i 
could be done to combat the j 
nuisance. I 

“But we can’t build another j 
warehouse,” argued Hafner. “Not J 
until the atomic generator is set 1 
up, at any rate. And then we’ll j 
have other uses for the power.” 1 
The executive rested his head in 
his hands. “I like the other solu- j 
tion better. Build one and see how ' 
it works.” 1 

“I was thinking of three,” said 
the biologist. 

“One,” Hafner insisted. “We J 
can’t spare the equipment until 1 
we know how it works.” 

At that he was probably right. ; 
They had equipment, as much * 
as three ships could bring. But 
the more they brought, the more f 
was expected of the colony. The 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



net effect was that equipment 
was always in short supply. 

Marin took the authorization 
to the engineer. On the way, he 
privately revised his specifications 
upward. If he couldn’t get as 
many as he wanted, he might as 
well get a better one. 

In two days, the machine was 
ready. 

It was delivered in a small 
crate to the warehouse. The crate 
was opened and the machine 
leaped out and stood there, 
poised. 

“A cat!” exclaimed the quarter- 
master, pleased. He stretched out 
his hand toward the black fuzzy 
robot. 

“If you’ve touched anything a 
mouse may have, get your hand 
away,” warned the biologist. “It 
reacts to smell as well as sight 
and sound.” 

Hastily, the quartermaster 
withdrew his hand. The robot dis- 
appeared silently into the maze 
of stored material. 

In one week, though there were 
still some mice in the warehouse, 
they were no longer a danger. 

T HE executive called Marin in- 
to his office, a small sturdy 
building located in the center of 
the settlement. The colony was 
growing, assuming an aspect of 
permanency. Hafner sat in his 
chadr and looked out over that 
growth with satisfaction.

“A good job on the mouse 
plague,” he said. 

The biologist nodded. “Not 
bad, except there shouldn’t be 
any mice here. Biological Sur- 
vey — ” 

“Forget it,” said the exec. 
“Everybody makes mistakes, 
even B. S.” He leaned back and 
looked seriously at the biologist. 
“I have a job I need done. Just 




now I’m short of men.. If you 
have no objections . .” 

The exec was always short of 
men, would be until the planet 
was overcrowded, and he would 
try to find someone to do the 
work his own men should have 
done. Dano Marin was not direct- 
ly responsible to Hafner; he was 
on loan to the expedition from 
Biological Controls. Still, it was 
a good idea to cooperate with the 
executive. He sighed. 

“It’s not as bad as you think,” 
said Hafner, interpreting the 

85 




sound correctly. He smiled. 
“We’ve got the digger together. I 
want you to run it.” 

Since it tied right in with his 
investigations, Dano Martin look- 
ed relieved and showed it. 

“Except for food, we have to 
import most of our supplies,” 
Hafner explained. “It’s a long 
haul, and we’ve got to make use 
of everything on the planet we 
can. We need oil. There are going 
to be a lot of wheels turning, 
and everyone of them will have to 
have oil. In time we’ll set up a 
synthetic plant, but if we can 
locate a productive field now, 
it’s to our advantage.” 

“You’re assuming the geology 
of Glade is similar to Earth?” 
Hafner waggled his hand. 
“Why not? It’s a nicer twin of 
Earth.” 

Why not? Because you couldn’t 
always tell from the surface, 
thought. Marin. It seemed like 
Earth, but was it? Here was a 
good chance to find out the his- 
tory of Glade. 

Hafner stood up. “Any time 
you’re ready, a technician will 
check you out on the digger. 
Let me know before you go.” 

A CTUALLY, the digger wasn’t 
a digger. It didn’t move or 
otherwise displace' a gram of dirt 
or rock. It was a means of look- 
ing down below the surface, to 
any practical depth. A large 



crawler, it was big enough for a 
man to live in without discom- . 
fort for a week. W 

It carried an outsize ultra- 
sonic generator and a device for 
directing the beam into • the 
planet. That was the sending 
apparatus. The receiving end be- c 
gan with a large sonic lens which g 
picked up sound beams reflected 'f 
from any desired depth, converted 
it into electrical energy and | 
thence into an image which was 
flashed onto a screen. 

At the depth of ten miles, the 
image was fuzzy, though good ’t 
enough to distinguish the main ' 
features of the strata. At three 
miles, it was better. It could pick « 
up the sound reflection of a 
buried coin and convert it into a 
picture on which the date could 
be seen. | 

It was to a geologist as a micro- 
scope is to a biologist. Being | 
a biologist, Dano Marin could ? 
appreciate the analogy. 

He started at the tip of the 
peninsula and zigzagged across, 
heading toward the isthmus. 
Methodically, he covered the 
territory, sleeping at night in thi 
digger. On the morning of th f 
third day, he discovered oil traces 
and by that afternoon he had lo- 
cated the main field. ' 

He should probably have turn- 
ed back at once, but now that hr 
had found oil, he investigated 
more deliberately. Starting at the 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



top, he let the image range 
downward below the top strata. 

It was the reverse of what it 
should have been. In the top few 
feet, there were plentiful fossil 
remains, mostly of the four spe- 
cies of mammals. The squirrel- 
like creature and the far larger 
grazing animal were the forest 
dwellers. Of the plains animals, 
there were only two, in size fitting 
neatly between the extremes of 
the forest dwellers. 

After the first few feet, which 
corresponded to approximately 
twenty thousand years, he found 
virtually no fossils. Not until he 
reached a depth which he could 
correlate to the Late Carbonifer- 
ous age on Earth did fossils 
reappear. Then they were of ani- 
mals appropriate to the epoch. 
At that depth and below, the 
history of Glade was quite simi- 
lar to Earth’s. 

Puzzled, he checked again in 
a dozen widely scattered locali- 
ties. The results were always the 
same — fossil history for the first 
twenty thousand years, then none 
for roughly a hundred million. 
Beyond that, it was easy to trace 
the thread of biological develop- 
ment. 

In that period of approximate- 
ly one hundred million years, 
something unique had happened 
to Glade. What was it? 

On the fifth day his investiga- 
tions were interrupted by the 



sound of the keyed-on radio. 
“Marin.” 

“Yes?” He flipped on the send- 
ing switch. 

“How soon can you get back?” 
He looked at the photo-map. 
“Three hours. Two if I hurry.” 
“Make it two. Never mind the 
oil.” 

“I’ve found oil. But what’s the 
matter?” 

“You can see it better than I 
can describe it. We’ll discuss it 
when you get back.” 

R ELUCTANTLY, Marin re- 
tracted the instruments into 
the digger. He turned it around 
and, with not tdo much regard 
for the terrain, let it roar. The 
treads tossed dirt high in the air. 
Animals fled squealing from in 
front of him. If the grove was 
small enough, he went around it, 
otherwise he went through and 
left matchsticks behind. 

He skidded the crawler ponder- 
ously to halt near the edge of 
the settlement. The center of ac- 
tivity was the warehouse. Pickups 
wheeled in and out, transferring 
supplies to a cleared area outside. 
He found Hafner in a corner of 
the warehouse, talking to the en- 
gineer. 

Hafner turned around when he 
came up. “Your mice have grown, 
Marin.” 

Marin looked down. The robot 
cat lay on the floor. He knelt 



STUDENT BODY 



87 




and examined it. The steel skele- 
ton hadn’t broken; it had been 
bent, badly. The tough plastic 
skin had been torn off and, in- 
side, the delicate mechanism had 
been chewed into an unrecogniz- 
able mass. 

Around the cat were rats, 
twenty or thirty of them, huge 
by any standards. The cat had 
fought; the dead animals were 
headless or disembowled, unbe- 
lievably battered. But the robot 
had been outnumbered. 

Biological Survey had said 
there weren’t any rats on Glade. 
They had also said that about 




mice. What was the key to their 
error? 

The biologist stood up. “What 
are you going to do about it?’’ 
“Build another warehouse, two- 
foot -thick fused dirt floors, mono- 
lithic construction. Transfer all 
perishables to it.” 

Marin nodded. That would do 



it. It would take time, of course, 
and power, all they could draw 
out of the recently set up atomic 
generator. All other construction 
would have to be suspended. No 
wonder Hafner was disturbed. 

“Why not build more cats?” 
Marin suggested. 

The executive smiled nastily. 
“You weren’t here when we 
opened the doors. The warehouse 
was swarming with rats. How 
many robot cats would we need 
— five, fifteen? I don’t know. 
Anyway the engineer tells me we 
have enough parts to build three 
more cats. The one lying there 
can’t be salvaged.” 

It didn’t take an engineer to 
see that, thought Marin. 

Hafner continued, “If we need 
more, we’ll have to rob the com- 
puter in the spaceship. I refuse 
to permit that.” 

Obviously he would. The space- 
ship was the only link with 
Earth until the next expedition 
brought more colonists. No exec 
in his right mind would permit 
the ship to be crippled. 

But why had Hafner called 
him back? Merely to keep him 
informed of the situation? 

H AFNER seemed to guess his 
thoughts. “At night we’ll 
floodlight the supplies we remove 
from the warehouse. We’ll post a 
guard armed with decharged 
rifles until we can move the food 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



88 



into the new warehouse. That’ll 
take about ten days. Meanwhile, 
our fast crops are ripening. It’s 
my guess the rats will turn to 
them for food. In order to protect 
our future food supply, you’ll 
have to activate your animals.” 

The biologist started. “But it’s 
against regulations to loose any 
animal on a planet until a com- 
plete investigation of the pos- 
sible ill effects is made.” 

“That takes ten or twenty 
years. This is an emergency and 
I’ll be responsible — in writing, 
if you want.” 

The biologist was effectively 
countermanded. Another . rabbit- 
infested Australia or the planet 
that the snails took over might 
be in the making, but there was 
nothing he could do about it. 

“I hardly think they’ll be of 
any use against rats this size,” 
he protested. 

“You’ve got hormones. Apply 
them.” The executive turned and 
began discussing construction 
with the engineer. 

1^/1^ ARIN had the dead rats 
gathered up and placed in 
the freezer for further study. 

After that, he retired to the 
laboratory and worked out a 
course of treatment for the do- 
mesticated animals that the col- 
onists had brought with them. 
He gave them the first injections 
and watched them carefully until 



they were safely through the ini- 
tial shock phase of growth. As 
soon as he saw they were going 
to survive, he bred them. 

Next he turned to the rats. Of 
note was the wide variation in 
size. Internally, the same thing 
was true. They had the usual 
organs, but the proportions of 
each varied greatly, more than 
is normal. Nor were their teeth 
uniform. Some carried huge fangs 
set in delicate jaws; others had 
tiny teeth that didn’t match the 
massive bone structure. As a spe- 
cies, they were the most scram- 
bled the biologist had ever 
encountered. 

He turned the microscope on 
their tissues and tabulated the 
results. There was less difference 
here between individual speci- 
mens, but it was enough to set 
him pondering. The reproductive 
cells were especially baffling. 

Late in the day, he felt rather 
than heard the soundless whoosh 
of the construction machinery. He 
looked out of the laboratory and 
saw smoke rolling upward. As 
soon as the vegetation was char- 
red, the smoke ceased and heat 
waves danced into the sky. 

They were building on a hill. 
The little creatures that crept and 
crawled in the brush attacked in 
the most vulnerable spot, the food 
supply. There was no brush, not 
a blade of grass, on the hill when 
the colonists finished.

T ERRIERS. In the past, they 
were the hunting dogs of the 
agricultural era. What they lack- 
ed in size they made up in 
ferocity toward rodents. They 
had earned their keep originally 
in granaries and fields, and, for 
a brief time, they were doing it 
again on colonial worlds where 
conditions were repeated. 

The dogs the colonists brought 
had been terriers. They were still 
as fast, still with the same anti- 
rodent disposition, but they were 
no longer small. It had been a 
difficult job, yet Marin had done 
it well, for the dogs had lost 
none of their skill and speed in 
growing, to the size of a great 
dane. 

The rats moved in on the fields 
of fast crops. Fast crops were 
made to order for a colonial 
world. They could be planted, 
grown, *and* harvested in a matter 
of weeks. After four such plant- 
ings, the fertility of the soil was 
destroyed, but that meant nothing 
in the early years of a colonial 
planet, for land was plentiful. 

The rat tide grew in the fast 
crops, and' the dogs were loosed 
on the rats. They ranged through 
the fields, hunting. A rush, a snap 
of their jaws, the shake of a 
head, and the rat was tossed 
aside, its back broken. The dogs 
went on to the next. 

Until they could not see, the 
dogs prowled and slaughtered. 



At night they came in bloody, 
most of it not their own, and ex- 
hausted. Marin pumped them full 
of antibiotics, bandaged their 
wounds, fed them through their 
veins, and shot them into sleep. 
In the morning he awakened 
them with an injection of stimu- 
lant and sent them tingling into 
battle. 

It took the rats two days to 
learn they could not feed during 
the day. Not so numerous, they 
came at night. They climbed on 
the vines and nibbled the fruit. 
They gnawed growing grain and 
ravaged vegetables. 

The next day the colonists set 
up lights. The dogs were with 
them, discouraging the few rats 
who were still foolish enough to 
forage while the sun was over- 
head. 

An hour before dusk, Marin 
called the dogs in and gave them 
an enforced rest. He brought them 
out of it after dark and took them 
to the fields, staggering, ^he 
scent of rats revived them; they 
were as eager as ever, if not 
quite so fast. 

The rats came from the sur- 
rounding meadows, not singly, or 
in twos and threes, as th§y had 
before; this time they came to- 
gether. Squealing and rustling 
the grass, they moved toward the 
fields. It was dark, and though 
he could not see them, Marin 
could hear them. He ordered the 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




great lights turned on in the area • 
of the fields. 

The rats stopped under the 
glare, milling around uneasily. 
The dogs quivered and whined. 
Marin held them back. The rats 
resumed their march, and Marin 
released the dogs. 

The dogs charged in to attack, 
but didn’t dare brave the main 
mass. They picked off the strag- 
glers and forced the rats into a 
tighter formation. After that the 
rats were virtually unassailable. 

The colonists could have burn- 
ed the bunched-up rats with the 
right equipment, but they didn’t 
have it and couldn’t get it for 
years. Even if they’d had it, the 
use of such equipment would en- 
danger the crops, which they had 
to save if they could. It was 
up to the dogs. 

The rat formation came to the 
edge of the fields, and broke. 
They could face a common ene- 
my and remain united, but in 
the presence of food, they forgot 
that unity and scattered — hunger 
was the great divisor. The dogs 
leaped joyously in pursuit. They 
hunted down the starved rodents, 
one by one, and killed them as 
they ate. 

When daylight came, the rat 
menace had ended. 

The next week the colonists 
harvested and processed the food 
for storage and immediately 
planted another crop. 

STUDENT BODY 




M ARIN sat in the lab and 
tried to analyze the situa- 
tion. The colony was moving 
from crisis to crisis', all of them 
involving food. In itself, each 
critical situation was minor, but 
lumped together they could add 
up to failure. No matter how 
he looked at it, they just didn’t 
have the equipment they needed 
to colonize Glade. 

The fault seemed to lie with 
Biological Survey; they hadn’t 
reported the presence of pests 
that were endangering the food 
supply. Regardless of what the

interest settle on the executive’s 
face as he stated the obvious. 
Well, it was obvious, up to a 
point. The conclusions weren’t, 
though. 

“Between a hundred million 
years and twenty thousand years 
ago, something happened to 
Glade,” Marin went on. “I don’t 
know the cause; it belongs to 
cosmic history and we may never 
find out. Anyway, whatever the 
cause — fluctuations in the sun, 
unstable equilibrium of forces 
within the planet, or perhaps an 
encounter with an interstellar, 
dust cloud of variable density — 
the climate on Glade changed. 

“It changed with inconceiv- 
able violence and it kept on 
changing. A hundred million 
years ago, plus or minus, there 
was carboniferous forest on 
Glade. Giant reptiles resembling 
dinosaurs and tiny mammals 
roamed through it. The first great 
change wiped out the dinosaurs, 
as it did on Earth. It didn’t 
wipe out the still more primitive 
ancestor of the omnivore, be- 
cause it could adapt to changing 
conditions. 

“Let me give you an idea how 
the conditions changed. For a 
few years a given area would be 
a desert; after that it would turn 
into a jungle. Still later a glacier 
would begin to form. And then 
the cycle would be repeated, with 
wild variations. All this might 

STUDENT BODY 



happen — did happen — within a 
span covered by the lifetime of a 
single omnivore. This occurred 
many times. For roughly a hun- 
dred million years’ it was the 
norm of existence on Glade. This 
condition was hardly conducive 
to the preservation of fossils.” 
Hafner saw the significance and 
was concerned. “You mean these 
climatic fluctuations suddenly 
stopped, twenty thousand years 
ago? Are they likely to begin 
again?” 

“I don’t know,” confessed the 
biologist. “We can probably de- 
termine it if we’re interested.” 
The exec nodded grimly. 
“We’re interested, all right.” 
Maybe we are, thought the bi- 
ologist. He said, “The point is 
that survival was difficult. Birds 
could and did fly to more suit- 
able climates; quite a few of them 
survived. Only one species of 
mammals managed to come 
through.” 

“Your facts are not straight,” 
observed Hafner. “There are four 
species, ranging in size from a 
squirrel to a water buffalo.” 

“One species,” Marin repeated 
doggedly. “They’re the same. If 
the food supply for the largest 
animal increases, some of the 
smaller so-called species grow up. 
Conversely, if food becomes 
scarce in any category, the next 
generation, which apparently can 
be produced almost instantly, 

93 




switches to a form which does 
have an adequate food supply.” 
“The mice,” Hafner said slow- 
ly. 

TMTARIN finished the thought 
for him. “The mice weren’t 
here when we got here. They 
were born of the squirrel-size om- 
nivore.” 

Hafner nodded. “And the 
rats?” 

“Bom of the next larger size. 
After all, we’re environment, too 
— perhaps the harshest the beasts 
have yet faced.” 

Hafner was a practical man, 
trained to administer a colony. 
Concepts were not his familiar 
ground. “Mutations, then? But I 
thought — ” 

The biologist smiled. It was 
thin and cracked at the edges of 
his mouth. “On Earth, it would 
be mutation. Here it is merely 
normal evolutionary adaptation.” 
He shook his head. “I never 
told you, but omnivores, though 
they could be mistaken for an 
animal from Earth, have no 
genes or chromosomes. Obvious- 
ly they do have heredity, but 
how it is passed down, I don’t 
know. However it functions, it 
responds to external conditions 
far faster than anything we’ve 
ever encountered.” 

Hafner nodded to himself. 
“Then we’ll never be free from 
pests.” He clasped and unclasped 



his hands. “Unless, of course, we 
rid the planet of all animal life.” 

“Radioactive dust?” asked the 
biologist. “They have survived 
worse.” 

The exec considered alterna- 
tives. “Maybe we should leave 
the planet and leave it to the 
animals.” 

“Too late,” said the biologist. 
“They’ll be on Earth, too, and 
all the planets we’ve settled on.” 

Hafner looked at him. The 
same pictures formed in his mind 
that Marin had thought of. Three 
ships had been sent to colonize 
Glade. One had remained with 
the colonists, survival insurance 
in case anything unforeseen hap- 
pened. Two had gone back to 
Earth to carry the report that 
all was well and that more sup- 
plies were needed. They had also 
carried specimens from the 
planet. 

The cages those creatures were 
kept in were secure. But a smaller 
species could get out, must al- 
ready be free, inhabiting, unde- 
tected, the cargo spaces of the 
ships. 

There was nothing they could 
do to intercept those ships. And 
once they reached Earth, would 
the biologists suspect? Not for a 
long time. First a new kind of rat 
would appear. A mutation could 
account for that. Without” specific 
knowledge, there would be noth- 
ing to connect it with the speci- 



94

mens picked up from Glade. 

“We have to stay,” said the 
biologist. “We have to study them 
and we can do it best here.” 

He thought of the vast com- 
plex of buildings on Earth. There 
was too much invested to tear 
them down and make them ver- 
minproof. Billions of people 
could not be moved off the planet 
while the work was being done. 

They were committed to Glade 
not as a colony, but as a gigantic 
laboratory. They had gained one 
planet and lost the equivalent of 
ten, perhaps more when the de- 
structive properties of the omni- 
vores were finally assessed. - 
A rasping animal cough inter- 
rupted the biologist’s thoughts. 
Hafner jerked his head and 



glanced out the window. Lips 

tight, he grabbed a rifle off the 
wall and ran out. Marin followed 
him. 

1 1 ^HE EXEC headed toward the 
fields where the second fast 
crop was maturing. On top of a 
knoll, he stopped and knelt. He 
flipped the dial to extreme 

charge, aimed, and fired. It was 
high; he missed the animal in 
the field. A neat strip of smoking 
brown appeared in the green 

vegetation. 

He aimed more carefully and 
fired again. The charge screamed 
out of the muzzle. It struck the 
animal on the forepaw. The 

beast leaped high in the air and 
fell down, dead and broiled.

They stood over the animal 
Hafner had killed. Except for 
the lack of markings, it was a 
good imitation of a tiger. The 
exec prodded it with his toe. 

“We chase the rats out of the 
warehouse and they go to the 
fields,” he muttered. “We hunt 
them down in the fields with 
dogs and they breed tigers.” 

“Easier than rats,” said Marin. 
“We can shoot tigers.” He bent 
down over the slain dog near 
which they had surprised the big 
cat. 

The other dog came whining 
from the far comer of the field 
to which he had fled in terror. 
He was a courageous dog, but he 
could not face the great carni- 
vore. He whimpered and licked 
the face of his mate. 

The biologist picked up the 
mangled dog and headed toward 
the laboratory. 

“You can’t save her,” said 
Hafner morosely. “She’s dead.” 

“But the pups aren’t. We’ll 
need them. The rats won’t disap- 
pear merely because tigers have 
showed up.” 

The head drooped limply over 
his arm and blood seeped into 
his clothing as Hafner followed 
him up the hill. 

“We’ve been here three 
months,” the exec said suddenly. 
“The dogs have been ih the fields 
only two. And yet the tiger was 
mature. How do you account for 



something like that?” 

Marin bent under the weight 
of the dog. Hafner never would 
understand his bewilderment. As 
a biologist, all his categories were 
upset. What did evolution ex- 
plain? It was a history of organic 
life on a particular world. Beyond 
that world, it might not apply. 

Even about himself there were 
many things Man didn’t know, 
dark patches in his knowledge 
which theory simply had to pass 
over. About other creatures, his 
ignorance was sometimes limit- 
less. 

Birth was simple; it occurred 
on countless planets. Meek graz- 
ing creatures, fierce carnivores — 
the most unlikely animals gave 
birth to their young. It happened 
all the time. And the young grew 
up, became mature and mated. 

He remembered that evening 
in the laboratory. It was acci- 
dental — what if he had been else- 
where and not witnessed it? They 
would not know what little they 
did. 

He explained it carefully to 
Hafner. “If the survival factor 
is high and there’s a great dis- 
parity in size, the young need not 
ever be young. They may be born 
as fully functioning adults!” 

A LTHOUGH not at the rate 
it had initially set, the colony 
progressed. The fast crops were 
slowed down and a more diversi- 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




fied selection was planted. New 
buildings were constructed and 
the supplies that were stored in 
them were spread out thin, for 
easy inspection. 

The pups survived and within 
a year shot up to maturity. After 
proper training, they were re- 
leased to the fields where they 
joined the older dogs. The battle 
against the rats went on; they 
were held in check, though the 
damage they caused was con- 
siderable. 

The original animal, unchang- 
ed in form, developed an appe- 
tite for electrical insulation. There 
was no protection except to keep 
the power on at all times. Even 
then there were unwelcome inter- 
ruptions until the short was lo- 
cated and the charred carcass 
was removed. Vehicles were kept 
tightly closed or parked only in 
verminproof buildings. While the 
plague didn’t increase in numbers, 
it couldn’t be eliminated, either. 

There was a flurry of tigers, 
but they were larger animals and 
were promptly shot down. They 
prowled at night, so the colon- 
ists were assigned to guard the 
settlement around the clock. 
Where lights failed to reach, the 
infra-red ’scope did. As fast as 
they came, the tigers died. Ex- 
cept for the first one, not a single 
dog was lost. 

The tigers changed, though not 
in form. Externally, they were 

STUDENT BODY 



all big and powerful killers. But 
as the Slaughter went on, Marin 
noticed one astonishing fact — the 
internal organic structure became 
progressively more immature. 

The last one that was brought 
to him for examination was the 
equivalent of a newly born cub. 
That tiny stomach was suited 
more for the digestion of milk 
than meat. How it had furnished 
energy to drive those great mus- 
cles was something of a miracle. 
But drive it had, for a murder- 
ous fifteen minutes before the 
animal wars brought down. No 
lives were lost, though sick bay 
was kept busy for a while. 

That was the last tiger they 
shot. After that, the attacks 
ceased. 

The seasons passed and nothing 
new occurred. A spaceship civil- 
ization or even that fragment of 
it represented by the colony was 
too much for the creature, which 
Marin by now had come to think 
of as the “Omnimal.” It had 
evolved out of a cataclysmic 
past, but it could not meet the 
challenge of the harshest environ- 
ment. 

Or so it seemed. 

TWiHREE months before the next 
colonists were due, a new ani- 
mal was detected. Food was miss- 
ing from the fields. It was not 
another tiger: they were carni- 
vorous. Nor rats, for vines were 

97 




stripped in a manner that no 
rodent could manage. 

The food was not important. 
The colony had enough in stor- 
age. But if the new animal sig- 
naled another plague, it was 
necessary to know how to meet it. 
The sooner they knew what the 
animal was, the better defense 
they could set up against it. 

Dogs were useless. The animal 
roamed the field they were loose 
in, and they did not attack nor 
even seem to know it was there. 

The colonists were called upon 
for guard duty again, but it evad- 
ed them. They patrolled for a 
week and they still did not catch 
sight of it. 

Hafner called them in and rig- 
ged up an alarm system in the 
field most frequented by the ani- 
mal. It detected that, too, and 
moved its sphere of operations 
to a field in which the alarm sys- 
tem had not been installed. 

Hafner conferred with the en- 
gineer, who devised an alarm that 
would react to body radiation. 
It was buried in the original field 
and the old alarm was moved to 
another. 

Two nights later, just before 
dawn, the alarm rang. 

Marin met Hafner at the edge 
of the settlement.. Both carried 
rifles. They walked; the noise of 
any vehicle was likely to frighten 
the animal. They circled around 
and approached the field from 



the rear. The men in the camp 
had been alerted. If they needed 
help, it was ready. 

They crept silently through the 
underbrush. It was feeding in 
the field, not noisily, yet they 
could hear it. The dogs hadn’t 
barked. 

They inched nearer. The blue 
sun of Glade came up and shone 
full on their quarry. The gun 
dropped in Hafner’s hand. He 
clenched his teeth and raised it 
again. 

Marin put out a restraining 
arm. “Don’t shoot,” he whispered. 

“I’m the exec here. I say it’s 
dangerous.” 

“Dangerous,” agreed Marin, 
still in a whisper. “That’s why 
you can’t shoot. It’s more dan- 
'gerous than you know.” 

Hafner hesitated and Marin 
went on. “The omnimal couldn’t 
compete in the changed environ- 
ment and so it evolved mice. We 
stopped the mice and it counter- 
ed with rats. We turned back the 
rat and it provided the tiger. 

“The tiger was easiest of all 
for us and so it was apparently 
stopped for a while. But it didn’t 
really stop. Another anima^ was 
being formed, the one you see 
there. It took the omnimal two 
years to create it — how, I don’t 
know. A million years were re- 
quired to evolve it on Earth.” 

Hafner hadn’t lowered the rifle 
and he showed no signs of doing 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



so. He looked lovingly into the 
sights. 

“Can’t you see?” urged Marin. 
“We can’t destroy the omnimal. 
It’s on Earth now, and on the 
other planets, down in the stor- 
age areas of our big cities, mas- 
querading as rats. And we’ve 
never been able to root out even 
our own terrestral rats, so how 
can we exterminate the omni- 
mal?” 

“All the more reason to start 
now.” Hafner’s voice was flat. 

Marin struck the rifle down. 
“Are their rats better than ours?” 
he asked wearily. “Will their 
pests win or ours be stronger? 
Or will the two make peace, 
unite and interbreed, make war 
on us? It’s not impossible; the 
omnimal could do it if inter- 
breeding had a high survival fac- 
tor. 

“Don’t you still see? There is 
a progression. After the tiger, it 
bred this. If this evolution fails, 
if we shoot it down, what will it 
create next? This creature I 
think we can compete with. It’s 
the one after this that I do not 
■ want to face.” 

IT HEARD them. It raised its 
-*■ head and looked around. Slow- 
ly it edged away and backed 
toward a nearby grove. 

The biologist stood up and call- 
ed softly. The creature scurried 
to the trees and stopped just in- 



side the shadows among them. 

The two men laid down their 
rifles. Together they approached 
the grove, hands spread open to 
show they carried no weapons. 

It came out to meet them. 
Naked, it had had no time to 
learn about clothing. Neither did 
it have weapons. It plucked a 
large white flower from the tree 
and extended this mutely as a 
sign of peace. 

“I wonder what it’s like,” said 
Marin. “It seems adult, but can 
it be, all the way through? What’s 
inside that body?” 

“I wonder what’s in his head,” 
Hafner said worriedly. 

It looked very much like a 
man.

Secret of the House 

By H. H. HOLMES 

Illustrated by EMSH 



It's spice that's the variety 
of interplanetary life — and 
it fust drove Kathy nutmeggyi 



O F course no one realized 
in advance what would 
be, ounce for ounce, the 
most valuable return cargo of the 
Earth-Venus ' spaceships, 1 even 
though the answer should have 
been obvious to anyone with the 
faintest knowledge of historical 
patterns. 

Rare metals? With the cost of 
fuel to lift them out of Venus’s 
almost-Earth gravity making 



them even costlier than on Earth 
itself? No, the answer was the ob- 
vious but overlooked one: What 
did Marco Polo bring back from 
China and Vasco da Gama from 
India? Why was Columbus seek- 
ing a new route to the Indies? 

In one word: spices. 

Man’s palate needs occasional 
rejuvenation. One of the main 
purposes of exploration, intercon- 
tinental or interplanetary, is the 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



restimulation of jaded taste buds. 
And in addition to the new spices 
there were new methods of cook- 
ing, such as that wonderful native 
Venusian quick passing through 
live steam, which gave the start- 
ling effect of sizzling hot crisp 
rawness; or balj, that strange na- 
tive dish which was a little like a 
curry and a little like a bouilla- 
baisse, but richer and more subtle 
than either. There was sokalj, or 
Venusian swamphog, the most 
delicately delicious meat on three 
planets — not that anything Mar- 
tian would ever be considered by 
the true gourmet. 

HPHIS was the speech that 
Kathy listened to regularly 
once a week for the first year of 
her marriage. For she had mar- 
ried not only a prominent and 
successful man, she soon realized, 
but one who had been bitten at a 
susceptible age by the word gour- 
met. 

It was fun while they were 
courting. It was fun, anyway, for 
a video network receptionist to 
be taken to good restaurants by 
the top interplanetary commen- 
tator. It was especially fun 
to watch him go through the 
masculine production number of 
conferring with the headwaiter, 
sending his compliments (and 
instructions) to the chef, and 
exchanging views with the som- 
melier, as Kathy quickly learned 



to call the-man-with-the-wine. 
Wine did not ship well inter- 
planetarily ; acceleration over one 
g, in the term of the cognoscenti, 
“bruised” it. In this domain, the 
French still reigned supreme, and 
stressed their superiority to mask 
their natural jealousy of the up- 
start Venusian colonists. 

In every American city — with a 
few exceptions in New Orleans 
and San Francisco — former 
“French” restaurants had become 
“Venusian” and even in Paris 
cuisine venerienne marked some 
of the most highly esteemed es- 
tablishments. 

But the entertainment value 
of a gourmet exhibitionist de- 
creased as courtship progressed 
logically into marriage, and being 
wined and dined gave place to 
the daily problem of feeding the 
man. Quick freezing had, of 
course, made the bride’s prob- 
lems simple compared to those 
of earlier centuries. But George, 
completely in character, insisted 
on a high percentage of person- 
ally prepared meals — and was 
shrewd enough to spot any sub- 
stitute makeshifts via the deep 
freeze and the electronic oven. 

Not even the apartment on 
the very top level of Manhattan, 
where you could still see the 
Hudson, not even the charge ac- 
counts at shops she’d never dared 
enter, not even the wondrous fact 
that she loved George with an 



SECRET OF THE HOUSE 



101 




intensity which she had always 
considered just an unlikely con- 
vention of the women’s mini- 
mags — none of these could quite 
reconcile Kathy to life with a 
man who could down three bowls 
of your best hand-made oyster 
stew without interrupting his 
speech on the glories of authentic 
balj a la Venusberg, who could 
devour enough of a prime rib 
roast to throw the whole week’s 
budget out of joint while ex- 
patiating on the absurdity of the 
legend that Earth, cooks in gen- 
eral, and the Anglo-Saxons in 
particular, did at least under- 
stand beef. 

IV' ATHY toyed with the idea 
■*-*- of hiring a cook, not so much 
to satisfy George as to divert his 
inevitable reproaches to someone 
else. But aside from the fact 
that a cook’s salary would turn 
her charge accounts anemic,' 
Kathy knew that her mother, 
both her grandmothers, and un- 
doubtedly all four of her great- 
and all eight of her great-great- 
grandmothers had fed their men 
and kept them happy. This was 
a matter of family pride. 

Then came the awful day when 
George brought Jose Lermontov 
home to dinner. Kathy’s younger 
sister was also dining with them 
that night, and wrinkled her nose 
after George’s face faded from 
the visiphone. 

SECRET OF THE HOUSE 



“These revolting Venus-colon- 
ial diplomats,” said Linda. “He’ll 
have a swamp-beard and a 
paunch and a wife and six chil- 
dren at home. Kathy, why 
doesn’t George ever meet any- 
body newsworthy who’s — well, 
worthy?” 

“He’s a very fine young man, 
I hear,” Kathy muttered dis- 
tractedly. “Guerilla leader against 
the dictatorship, wrote a fine 
book about its overthrow. What 
worries me is the paunch — and 
what I’m going to put into it.” 

Five minutes after meeting the 
Venusian, Linda slipped into the 
kitchen to whisper, “Sister . 
please . can I have that in my 
stocking for Christmas?” But 
even this pleasing reversal did not 
divert Kathy from the task of 
preparing to fill the, as it turned 
out, non-existent paunch. 

Dinner, she thought a little 
later, was going surprisingly well, 
especially between Jose and 
Linda. But then George, having 
speared and destroyed the last 
pork chop, cleared his throat. 

“You must make allowances, 
Lermontov. Mere pork to a man 
accustomed to s okalj . .” 

“Mean swamphog?” Jose asked 
politely, with the usual clipped 
Venusian avoidance of pronouns 
and articles. 

“And,” George added commis- 
eratingly, “this so-called ‘country 
gravy’ — rather a shock to a man 

103 




from a planet where they think, 
thank God, not in terms of gra- 
vies, but of sauces.” 

“Very good gravy,” said Jose, 
mopping up the last of his with a 
slice of Kathy’s own bread. “Ima- 
gine ‘so-called’ because first made 
by those who live in country?” 
“Even granting that,” George 
persisted, “can’t you picture what 
just a pinch of ba/j-powder 
would have done for it? Or per- 
haps a hint of tinilj?” 

“Myself,” Jose replied gravely, 
“prefer one of your Earth herbs 
—dash of oregano, bit of savory. 
Summer savory, of course.” 

George gave the matter serious 
thought. “Possibly. Very possi- 
bly. But in either case it 
demonstrates the pitiful lack of 
imagination of the average Earth 
housewife.” 

It is conceivable that Kathy 
made too obvious a clatter in 
stacking and removing the din- 
ner dishes. In any event, Linda 
followed her hastily into the 
kitchen. 

“Please, Kathy angel, don’t ex- 
plode, not just yet. I know George 
is asking for it, but he’s probably 
been told already that all Earth- 
women are shrews and I don’t 
want ...” 

Kathy controlled herself until 
the one agreeable result of the 
evening was reached when Jos€ 
asked if he might see Linda home. 
To her surprise, she went right on 

104 G 



controlling herself even after they 
had left, because by then she 
had thought of The Plan. | 

npHE very next morning, The 
-*• Plan was well under way. 

A: Kathy invaded her favor- f 
ite bookshop and bought every 
book in stock on Venusian spices 
and cooking, and even added 
such pre-Venusian classics of cul- 
inary perception as Brillat- 
Savarin, Escoffier, and M. F. K. 
Fisher. 

B: She enrolled herself for 
daily lessons at the Uya Rulj 
School of Venusian Cookery (for- 
merly the Ecole de Cuisine Cor- 
don Bleu). 

C: Knowing that George had 
a luncheon date in Chicago with 
his sponsor, she visited the res- 
taurant where her husband 
normally lunched. It was an un- 
obtrusive chop house in the thir- 
ties, far down on Manhattan’s 
base-level, and the excellent 
lunch she enjoyed there con- 
firmed her darkest suspicions. 

For two weeks she read her 
books and took her lessons with- 
out trying out what she learned 
except for lunches by herself. 
And she did learn things. George’s 
school of thought had its points. 
For Kathy’s cooking, like that of 
her eight great-great-grandmoth- 
ers, had been not only Earthly 
but plain American. 

There was a fresh delight in 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




learning that the Architect of all 
things had established on this 
planet a certain inevitable rela- 
tionship between tomatoes and 
sweet basil, and had ordained 
that caraway seeds should ful- 
fill the destiny of red cabbage — 
even as on another planet He had 
sown tinilj so that the flesh of the 
swamphog might be even sweeter. 
And who was to anticipate the 
masterfully predestined inter- 
planetary blends? The inescap- 
able kinship of garlic and lamb. 
Kathy had long known, but her 
eyes opened wide on discovering 
how a pinch of ba/;- powder com- 
pleted the trinity. 

But these discoveries did not 
weaken The Plan. And that same 
Architect smiled upon The Plan 
by allowing the network’s robo- 
waxer to deposit a minutely over- 
sufficient flow upon the floor of 
the corridor in front of George’s 
office. On that wax, George slip- 
ped and broke his leg. 

George probably never ad- 
mitted, even to himself, that he 
enjoyed being bedridden: the 

visiphone calls, the mini-script 
couriers from the network, the 
bedside microphone and cameras. 
But he did begin to admit that he 
was enjoying Kathy’s cooking. 

Where once she might have 
served steak, she now brought 
forth grenadine de boeuf a la 
venerienne. Where once she might 
have served her asparagus with 



melted butter, she now ventured 
on a hollandaise (with five grains 
of balj- powder replacing the cay- 
enne of ancient recipes). Where 
once she might have served left- 
over simply reheated, she now 
masked them with a sauce which 
would cause the recumbent 
George to smack his lips, roll his 
eyes, and murmur, “Silj, of 
course, and chives . and a hint 
of tinilj . possibly a whisper of 
pnutj, probably Earth-grown? 
Yes, I thought so .. and . 
what is that?” 

“Chevil, darling,” Kathy would 
say, and he’d answer, “Of course, 
of course. I would have had it in 
a minute. You know, Katherine 
my dear, you are developing an 
imagination!” 

W HEN it was announced that 
George’s plasticast was to 
come off that Thursday, Kathy 
decided it was time for the de- 
nouement of The Plan. As she 
was painstakingly making up her 
shopping list on Thursday morn- 
ing, the visiphone rang and it 
was, miraculously, not the net- 
work for George. 

“Oh, Kathy!” Linda burbled. 
“I’ve got one of those nice let’s- 
see- what -happens dates with him 
tonight and could you possibly 
ask us both to dinner? Because 
he likes you and he’s really just 
about almost there and if we were 
. you know, all in the family 



SECRET OF THE HOUSE 



105 



and everything, I think it might 
just — ” 

“Jose?” Kathy asked, knowing 
the answer. She grinned and dou- 
bled the quantities on the list. 

The worst of the preparations 
for dinner were over when Linda 
arrived, carrying, to Kathy’s sur- 
prise, a weekend case. The girl 
devoted only the necessary mini- 
mum of time to admiring 
George’s knitted leg, then drag- 
ged her sister into the bedroom. 

“Kathy, I’ve got such a prob- 
lem. He’s known so many women 
... all over two planets and at 
embassies and maybe even spies. 
I told you tonight I think he 
will; only I don’t know what 
lipstick to use, what perfume, 
anything. I’ve got to make my- 
self interesting; but I don’t want 
to overdo it. So I just brought 
everything I have. You tell me.” 

Kathy looked at the array. She 
thought of her dinner and The 
Plan and she began giving Linda 
her advice. 

TT was the same cast that had 
-*■ attended the awful dinner 
which inspired The Plan, but 
they were different people. Jose, 
no longer the visiting colonial, 
was a gentleman at home among 
friends; Linda was radiant in the 
glow of simplicity and a well- 
scrubbed face; and George was 
praising the food. 

He praised the green peas. He 



praised the mashed potatoes. And 
above all he praised the fried 
chicken. ff 

“I can’t quite analyze it,” he 
kept saying. “There’s a touch 
there I can’t quite get. You’ve 
brought out the flavor miracu- 
lously. It wouldn’t,” he demand- 
ed suspiciously, “be that new 
powder Koenigsberg claims he 
found among the natives at the 
tip of the southern continent? I 
thought they hadn’t shipped any 
of that in yet.” 

“They haven’t,- darling,” said 
Kathy. 

“Perhaps the tiniest pinch of 
balj with a little freshly ground 
celery seed?” 

“No.” 

“Then what in two planets — ” 
“A woman must have some se- 
crets, George. Let’s just say this 
is ... a secret of the house.” 

At this point Kathy happened 
to catch Josh’s eye and hastily 
looked away. It was impossible 
that a Venusian diplomat would 
be winking at his hostess! 

George was still pursuing his 
questions over brandy in the liv- 
ing room. Jose, also possibly 
(Kathy prayed) in a question- 
asking mood, had led Linda out 
onto what the architect called the 
sun-area, though Kathy per- 
sisted in thinking of it, more ro- 
mantically, as the balcony. As 
she saw the two turn to come 
back in, Kathy headed for the 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



kitchen, an immemorial spot for 
sisterly confidences. 

But it was not Linda who fol- 
lowed her in. It was Jose. He 
leaned casually against the door 
jamb and told her, “Know se- 
cret of house.” 

“Yes?” said Kathy casually. 
“Oh, I mean — you do? Some- 
times I have to stop and reread 
you, like a telegram. Well?” 

“Bought food of highest qual- 
ity, cooked it extremely well, re- 
lied on nothing but natural flavor, 
probably little salt. Good old 
George always wanted so much 
seasoning, this strikes him as new 
and revolutionary taste sensa- 
tion. Right?” 

K ATHY grinned. “I’ll go quiet- 
ly,” she said. “I thought it 
would work and I was sure of 
it when I ate at his regular lunch 
place. That’s just what they do; 
but because it’s a chop house 
with a reputation, he thinks it’s 
magic. Except I’ve learned things 
his way, too. From now on, 
George- gets variety at home — 
and I think he’ll like all of it 
without ever knowing why he 
likes which.” 

“Simplicity also magic,” Jos6 
observed. “Your idea — clean, 
fresh simplicity of Linda that 
accounts for fact am going to be 



your brother-in-law. Correct?” 
“Correct? It’s perfect!" Impul- 
sively, Kathy kissed him. “Oh, 
my!” she said as she drew back. 
“Now you’ve got lipstick after 
coming off the balcony spotless!” 
“Variety,” said Jose approv- 
ingly. “Still wonder one thing,

“Now that you’re part of the

“Yes?” 

“The secret is this: I take lots 
of butter and cream — real cow- 
stuff, no syntho — and I beat the

When they returned to the liv-

“Let tonight’s dinner be a mar- 
ital lesson to you, my boy. Re- 
member the last time you ate

This time there was no doubt 
whatsoever that the gentlemanly 
Venusian diplomat was winking 
at his hostess.

¥T is rare that this sour-grapes 
reviewer goes all-out about an 
anthology; there have been too 
many -and most have been of poor 
quality. Here is one, however, 
that is way up on the top of the 
pile: an “idea” anthology that 
contains fantasy and science fic- 
tion and thrives on both. 

There are 2 1 tales in the vol- 
ume, all of which tell about odd 
and unlikely varieties of life (and 
“non-life”) on or off our planet. 
All but three rate B-f- or better. 



A rather rare high average. 

Life types range from sentient 
houses (William Tenn) and 
whirlwinds (Robert Heinlein) to 
more or less standard robots, 
BEMS and alien invaders, none, 
however, in the least routinely 
described. There are tales of 
ghosts, werewolves, mutants, an- 
gels, “creatures,” gnomes and, 
often best of all, completely real 
and civilized beings on or from 
other planets and realms. 

Authors whose tales particu- 
larly enchanted me, in addition 
to the two men mentioned above, 
are Mark Clifton, Eric Frank 
Russell, Theodore Sturgeon, Lau- 
rence Manning (with a very

cher, Roger Dee, Lester del Rey, 
and Murray Leinster. Del Rey’s 
“Helen O’Loy,’’ incidentally, is 
the only story to have first been 
published before 1940. 

There is an excellent short 
bibliography of strange-life stor- 
ies that have appeared in other 
anthologies: a fine idea, but here 
a little too short to be truly 
representative.

FT1HE second volume in the Cog- 
gins-Pratt series on astronau- 
tics for the younguns is just as 
good as the first, which was (see 
GALAXY, January 1952) superb. 
The present volume takes you 
from Earth to the first Space 
Station, to the Moon — and does 
so in plain and not-too-technical 
language and in magnificent pic- 
tures, half of which are in full 
color. 

No attempt is made to over- 
dramatize the humdrum aspects 
of the undertaking, or to over- 
simplify. While it does not make 
the job sound easy, it does make 
it easy to understand, both in 
writing and in the illustrations.

W HY do people generally ig- 
nore Mark Twain’s “science 
fiction?” Could it be because all 
his fantasy was bitterly satiric? 
That may be, but the best science 
fiction is shrewd, penetrating and 
often sharp in tone. 

Well, here is Mark Twain at 
his satiric -fantastic best. The 
book is an expanded version, pre- 
pared by the late Dixon Wecter, 
of Mark’s famous squib against 
pomposity in religion and in daily 
life, “Captain Stormfield’s Visit 
to Heaven,” plus a hitherto un- 
published satire on the same 
theme, “Letter From the Record- 
ing Angel.” 

Two brand-new chapters in 
the Stormfield saga open the 
book with - a superb attack on 
race prejudice. “The Recording 
Angel” slashingly satirizes hy- 
pocrisy and the meanness of 
miserly wealth; and the whole

wonderful document presents 
some of the most hilariously bit- 
ing satire — and some of the rich- 
est science fiction imagination— 
that has ever appeared in print.

* 

TT is with a little hesitancy that 
I discuss this book in these 
columns. Witchery is probably 
not appropriate here — especially 
stories which try to kid the reader 
into actually believing in super- 
natural powers. 

Nearly the best thing about 
this volume is John Ciardi’s 
sharp and poetic introduction, an 
appreciative review of the anthro- 
pological origins of belief in 
witches and a deftly subtle anal- 
ysis of witch types. 

As for the three novelets them- 
selves, I find Leiber’s “Conjure 
Wife,” from a 1943 Unknown 
Worlds, to be straight-faced (and 
very well-done) obscurantism, 
based on the concept of the soul 
as a tangible (and stealable) 
article. 

Blish’s relatively short “There 
Shall Be No Darkness,” from a 



1950 Thrilling Wonder Stories, 
is somewhat more persuasive for 
me, perhaps because it is closer 
to being science fiction. 

It is Fletcher Pratt’s “The Blue 
Star,” however, nearly novel - 
length by itself, that provides the 
real surprise of the book. This 
never previously published tale is 
an immensely effective piece of 
mannered pseudo-historical writ- 
ing, a recreation of a time when 
witchcraft was really believed in 
— in this instance on a parallel 
world that is only slightly dif- 
ferent from our world during its 
medieval period. It is full of color, 
sex, and wonderful, robust char- 
acters. The witchcraft, because 
it is placed in a suitable environ- 
ment, is quite believable.- 

For my money. Witches Three 
is worth buying especially be- 
cause of the excellent imaginings 
in Fletcher Pratt’s splendid bar- 
oque tapestry.

It tells of the adventures of a

through the Spanish Civil War, 
and finally into modern Mexico, 
where the author of this book, 
famed in prewar Spain, is now 
living. These adventures are 
partly sharp anti-Fascism, partly 
straight bizarre romance, and 
partly (a large part) sheer non- 
sense, but the kind of poetic 
nonsense that loose- minded char- 
acters like the undersigned love.

ideas, and “action-packed” with- 
out leaning too heavily on car- 
nage and catastrophe, with one 
or two exceptions. 

Poul Anderson’s Vault of the 
Ages is one of the exceptions- — a 
grim and thrilling picture of civ- 
ilization destroyed and a bar- 
baric society beginning its way 
back up the scale by means of 
data found in a Twentieth Cen- 
tury Time Vault. 

Arthur Clarke’s Islands in the 
Sky is a wholly convincing tale 
of a boy’s adventures on our first 
artificial satellite. 

Chad Oliver’s Mists of Dawn 
is a dramatic but rather run-of- 
the-mill tale of a lad’s exciting 
doings in the year 50,000 B.C., 
where he was placed by an acci- 
dent to a time machine. 

Philip St. John’s Rocket 
Jockey is one of those rather old- 
fashioned tales of an “auto race” 
in space, with some nasty Mar- 
tians as villains. It is perhaps the 
least convincing of the five tales. 

Bryce Walton’s Sons of the 
Ocean Deep is a genuinely excit- 
ing story of the exploration of the 
ocean bottom, and of the very 
surprising things that are found 
there. It’s cast in the future, when 
space travel is old-hat. 

The series is just the thing for 
the growing generation, and a 
fine lead-in for them to more 
adult science fiction eventually.

W ATER was always short 
between planets, even 
on a ship like the Iron- 
rod, so my first goal in Forbeston 
on Mars was always the pool. I 
stripped down to trunks, ultra- 
violet checked, and plunged out 
into the green-tinted water. After 
blowing around a while, I lay 
back and floated. Above, beyond 
the almost invisible protective 
dome, there was the purple velvet 
of the Martian sky, flecked, now 



that the Sun was low on the hor- 
izon, with the larger stars. One of jj 
them, unwinking and tremendous, 1 
was green — Earth, of course. 

From the pool to the club; the : 
usual routine. The Senior Officers’ ; 
Club was on the corner of 49th j 
and X, just across from the De- j 
partment of Commerce building.

Steve said: “Where’ve you I’d heard the complaint from, 

been, Captain Newsam?” him before, and also from others 

The individual naming was an- in Forbeston and at other land- 
other part of his technique. I had falls. They mostly looked conten-

“One place is like another,” I 
told him tiredly. 

“Yes,” he said. “I’ve heard 
that. What you’re used to, I fig- 
ure. Going in to eat?” 

“Directly.” I dropped the voco- 
flips in a disposal chute. “Do 
something for me, Steve.” 

“Any old thing. What is it?” 
“Check me Captain Gains.” 

He didn’t hesitate long, but I’m 
used to observing small actions 
and probing them — I did a thesis 
on behavior for my diploma. I 
saw Steve’s eyes flicker, and the 
involuntary movement of his 
hands. 

He said: “I’ll check him, Cap- 
tain. I haven’t seen him around 
much lately.” s 

“How lately?” I asked quietly. 
He was smooth again now. 
“Well, you know how it is. With 
serving officers, you don’t always 
know whether they’re here or 
away. Even when they’re at Forb- 
eston, they don’t always come 
into the club. Hunting trips and 
such.” 

“Your memory’s not bad, 
Steve. Just when did you last see 
him?” 

He pretended to consider. 
“Might be two months. How long 
you been gone?” 

“Just over two months.” 

“Yes, I’d say that’s about it.” 
“Thanks. Check him for me 
all the same. Check him all over. 
I’m going in to eat.” 



I FOUND an empty table by 
the window, and ordered. 
This part of the club overlooked 
the playground of the Forbeston 
Junior School. I sat eating and 
watching the generation that 
would be prepared to take over 
when I had completed my twenty 
years in space and was ready to 
retire to that plantation up in 
the hills. I didn’t notice when 
someone came up to the table. 

He tapped the back of my chair. 
“Mind if I join you?" 

It was Matthews, from the 
Firelike. I had run into him at 
various times, in various places, 
and liked him well enough. I 'j 
nodded, and he sat down. 

“Just in?” 

“Three hours.” 

He nodded. “Been in over a 
week myself. We’re on the Ur- 
anus trip now. That’s a rough \ 
job I’ll be glad to see the end of. j 
We lost the Steelback on our 
last run. It’s a God-forsaken 1 
stretch of sky.” 

“One place is like another,” I 
said. It was the conventional 
phrase. j 

Matthews glanced at me. “Glad J 
you think so.” j 

“What else?” \ 

“People get ideas,” he said i 
vaguely. “Do you go near the | 
Earth at all on your present run?” i 
“The Moon. Clarke’s Point. 
Why?” 

“We used to hit Tycho. |

They’ve got a telescope there 
that’s pretty good. I used to get 
into the observatory. You can 
make out some small groups of 
buildings on Earth when the 
weather’s right.” 

The conversation was becom- 
ing embarrassing. To mention 
Earth at all was bad enough; to 
speak of “weather” was some- 
thing worse. I looked at Mat- 
thews. He seemed normal, but I 
thought I detected a watchful- 
ness behind the placidity of his 
expression. 

I said deliberately: “I’ve never 
given it a thought.” 

“Sometimes people get to act- 
ing peculiar. We had a second of- 
ficer with us three or four years 
back. He got an idea in his head 
that the Earth was raising a bat- 
tle fleet. He used to spend his 
off-duty time at the lookout 
screen watching for the enemy 
cruisers approaching.” 

I laughed. “What did they do 
with him?” 

“Gave him the drop. I guess 
he knows better by now.” 

“If he’s still alive.” 

Matthews paused for a mo- 
ment. “Have you ever wondered 
why we drop the misfits back to 
Earth?” 

I looked at him again. “What 
is there to think about? The rea- 
son’s obvious enough. Since the 
ruling was made against pre- 
frontal leucotomy, it’s the only 



alternative to snuffing them out, 
unless they are kept in institu- 
tions at our expense.” 

He drained his coffee. “I’ve 
known some to say that we should 
never have abandoned Earth. 
It’s richer in natural resources 
than all the planets together.” 

I added: “And populated to the 
tune of around a billion savages. 
We couldn’t dispose of that lot, 
and we couldn’t avoid being con- 
taminated if we had to live 
among them. The reason our kind 
came to the planets was to get 
away from them, to be able to 
develop our superior civilization 
in peace and without interrup- 
tion. We’ve got the Sirius project 
under way. In a couple of cen- 
turies we may be in a different 
solar system altogether.” 

“Or we may not,” Matthews 
corrected. “There have been quite 
a few earlier projects, starting 
with the Proxima Centauri proj- 
ect. That was two hundred years 
ago.” 

“You sound pessimistic.” 

“It’s the Uranus trip,” he said. 
He grinned. “Forget it. One place 
is like another. Doing anything 
tonight?” 

“Nothing much. Looking a 
friend up.” 

“Yes,” he said. “I thought you 
might be.” 

The remark was, I felt, an en- 
igmatic one. He left without wait- 
ing for me to ask him to clarify it.

1 PASSED Steve on the way 
out. 

“Any luck with Captain 
Gains?” I asked him. 

He shook his head. 

“Forget it then. I’m going along 
to his place. There’ll be a mes- 
sage, even if he isn’t there.” 

Steve nodded. As I went out, 
he flicked the vidiphone switch 
in front of him. 

Larry’s bubble was seven or 
eight kilometers outside the city. 
I took my own car to the West 
Lock ' and picked up a sand 
tracker there. The Sun had set 
when I got outside the city bub- 
ble, but Phobos was up and I 
didn’t need to use the main lights 
to see my way. I made a good 
twenty and in about a quarter 
hour was under the ridge on 
which the bubble that surrounded 
Larry’s place was fixed. I could 
see it shimmering in the full 
moonlight, but there was no sign 
of a light within. 

I parked the tracker outside 
and went in. The lock was auto- 
matic ; as it closed behind me, the 
main lights inside went on. Lar- 
ry’s shack was in front of me. I 
pushed the door open. The living 
room looked reasonably tidy, but 
there was dust that showed no 
one had been in it for some weeks, 
at least. I went straight across 
to the vidiphone and pressed the 
message button. The screen 
stayed blank. 



-This was unusual. There should 
have been some kind of message. 
I set out to hunt through the 
shack for some kind of clue, but 
there was nothing. 

Larry Gains and I had gone 
through college at Tycho to- 
gether, and we graduated togeth- 
er. Our first four years in space 
we were on the same boat — the 
Graylance on the Asteroid Cir- 
cuit — and after the inevitable 
split came with my posting to the 
Ironrod, we still saw as much of 
each other as our wanderings 
permitted. Fortunately, both 
boats were based on For best on. 

Six months before, the old 
Graylance had made its last loop 




round the Belt; a chunk of rock 
weighing twenty tons or more 
had torn her open. Larry had 
been one of the survivors, but 
with injuries enough to ground 
him for at least a year. It was 
then he had had this shack put 
up. It was a handy base from / 
which to hunt rocktrotters. I had j: 
stayed out there with him on a V 
couple of leaves. Now the place . J 
was deserted. 

Might he have been seconded -13 
back into space on a special 
board? But there would have * 
been a message, either at the club 
or here. An extended trip, up onto 
the Kayser Plateau? Then again 
there should have been a mes-

sage; but he might not have ex- 
pected to be away for long. That 
seemed the only possible solu- 
tion. 

But there was the thick dust, 
and there had been that funny 
look in Steve’s eye when I had 
mentioned Larry. 

I began hunting aimlessly 
around the hut again. A tape of 
the Forbeston edition of the 
Tycho Capsule. I clipped it into 
the screen. 24 — 7. That made it 
just over two months old. 

I heard the door open behind 
me and turned around, half ex- 
pecting to see Larry himself 
there. But instead there were two 
men in Medical uniform. One of 
them stepped forward. 

“Captain Newsam?” He framed 
it as a question, but it was a 
statement. I knew that and 
nodded. 

“Just a checkup,” he said. 

“I had a- checkup. This after- 
noon. When I got in with the 
Ironrod.’’ 

“That’s all right,” the Medic 
said. “We won’t keep you long.” 

“You won’t keep me at all, I’ve 
had my checkup. You can reach 
me through Venus Base, if you’re 
interested.” 

I moved to pass them. The one 
who had been talking didn’t do 
anything. The other raised his 
left hand and shook it gently. 
Venusian arodate, of course, and 
they themselves immunized 



against it. I saw the golden dust 
shake out toward me and had ; 
time to run two or three paces 
before my muscles locked and 
everything went black. 

W HEN I awoke, I was in the j 
Medical building, back in 
Forbeston. My muscles were still j 
rigid. I was on a stretcher un- '] 
derneath the Verifier. The two | 
Medics were there, and a Medic 
Captain. He was a little tubby 
man with ginger whiskers and a 
toothy grin. 

He said: “Sorry about the in- i 
formality. Just a routine. We did ; 
have a warrant, incidentally, in 
case you should feel like legist er- 
ing a complaint against us.” 

Being underneath the Verifier | 
explained the arodate, but it 
didn’t explain why. I thought of 
saying something and then de- f 
cided to keep my mouth shut. 
The electrodes were clamped 
neatly behind my ears. The globe 
of the Verifier glowed its normal ‘ 
pink. 

The Captain said : “My name’s 
Pinski. Now, Captain Newsam, 
you are Chief Navigator of the 
Ironrod, on the Venus-Mercury 
run?” 

“Yes.” 

“Landfall five hours back?” 

“If I’ve been out half an hour, 
yes.” 

The questions continued. For 
the most part, they were routine.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Pinski kept one eye on the Veri- 
fier globe, Then he started toss- 
ing in a few more unusual ones. 

“Ever been among the outer 
planets?” 

“Beyond the Asteroids? No.” 
“Do you know Commander 
Leopold?” 

“No.” 

“Commander Stark?” 

“No.” 

“What are your views on pre- 
frontal leucotomy?” 

“Never thought about it. It’s 
not used now, is it? They give 
them the drop.” 

“What do you think of the 
Sirius project?” 

“Not much interested.” 

“Do you ever dream of wide 
stretches of water?” 

“Not since I was a boy.” 

I had no reason to fear any- 
thing from the Verifier, so it 
didn’t make me nervous. The 
globe stayed pink as the ques- 
tions 'went on. 

Pinski said: “What were you 
doing at the place where the 
Medics found you?” 

“I was looking for Captain 
Gains. Perhaps you’ll tell me 
where I can get hold of him.” 
Pinski grinned. “I’m not under 
the Verifier, Captain Newsam.” 
He stepped back. “I think that’s 
all okay. Sorry to have bothered, 
you. In two or three minutes 
you’ll be' able to get around 
again. Call in the Bar on your 



way out. Third on the right along 
the corridor. I’ll be in there. The 
drinks are on Medical.” 

I found him all right. He was 
sitting at a table with two drinks 
in front of him. Someone must 
have told him I drank sloe gin. 
I sat down at the empty chair. 

“Glad to make your acquain- 
tance in a more formal manner. 
Captain Newsam,” Pinski said. 
“Have a drink.” 

I took it. “Now just \yhy — ” 

He lifted one hand. “To get 
things quite straight, I can give 
you no information as to the rea- 
son for your being picked up and 
verified.” 

“Right,” I said. “Then do you 
know where I can find Gains?” 
He hesitated briefly. “The an- 
swer must be no.” 

I swallowed the drink. “Thank 
you very much for all the hospi- 
tality. Good night, Captain Pin- 
ski.” 

“A piece of strictly medical ad- 
vice,” he said. “Go back to bed 
and have a good night’s sleep.” 

I called back, “Thanks!” I 
was halfway to the door.

I go I feel less and less like boast-

to the Saturn Room. Cynthia 
came at me from behind. 

“Hello! Long time.” 

“Seems longer,” 1 said. “Tell 
me, when was Larry in last?” 

“Larry? I haven’t seen him 
since you were both up here — 
nine, ten weeks ago. But I’ve been 
away on a trip up the Long Ca- 
nal. Tell you what, I’ll ask Sue.” 

“That’ll, be fine,” I said. 

She was gone two or three min- 
utes. When she came back, she 
said: “No. He doesn’t seem to 
have been around since then.” 

But she wasn’t being sponta- 
neous any longer; she was weigh- 
ing her words. And she didn’t 
seem at all curious as to what 
might have happened to him. 

“I thought we were friends, 
Cynth,” I said. “Come on, what 
is it?” 

“What’s what? I could do with,

I dropped a note on the table. 
“Have this one on Larry. See

that it was best not to inquire.” 

She was telling the truth now. 

"Thanks,” I said. “Good night, 
anyway.” 

“Where are you going?” 



“There’s only one place where 
I stand a chance of finding things $■ 
out.” £ 

I was thinking about that as |j, 
I went outside. The Terminal Of- If 
fice had tabs on all officers on 
the space routes. If Larry had 
not been reporting for his fort- 
nightly medical boards, they 
would know, and they would cer- 
tainly have checked to see what 
was happening. If there was 
something else wrong, they would 
know that, too. 

I jumped into the car without 
thinking and released power. 

Behind me, a familiar voice 
said: “You don’t seem to have 
had any luck in finding your 
friend, Captain Newsam.” 

It was Matthews. His tall body 
was cramped into the back of the 
car. 

“Good of you to join me,” I 
said. 

“I’d like you to drop in at my 
place. It’s on 72nd.” 

“Is there anything at the end 
of it? Information?” 

“A drink. Maybe information.” 
“Suits me,” I told him, and 
headed there. 

TT was a more luxurious apart - 
ment than I thought Matthews 
could have afforded. Four rooms, 
all well furnished. He set me 
down in a long chair in front of 
a glow-fire and brought me the 
drink. He had it right, too — sloe

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




gin — but the fact that everyone 
knew my taste in liquor had 
ceased to worry me. 

“Now,” I said, “I want to know 
where Larry Gains is.” 

Matthews raised his eyebrows. 
“Gains? Ah, he must be this 
friend you didn’t find.” 

I said wearily : “What informa- 
tion do you think I came here 
for?” 

“I thought you came for the 
drink. No, don’t go. If you try 
the Terminal Office at this time 
of night, you’ll only get the clerk, 
who will tell you to come back 
in the morning. Finish your drink 
and have another. I understand 
you got picked up for verification 
earlier this evening.” 

“Yes.” 

“What sort of questions did 
they ask you?” I told him and 
he nodded. “Leopold . Stark 
. That’s interesting.” 

“Just what is it all about?” 

He paused. “That little talk 
we had this afternoon. Remember 
it?” 

“More or less. You were talk- 
ing about misfits.” 

Matthews looked straight at 
me. “Captain Larry Gains was 
classified as a misfij: three weeks 
ago. He was dropped to Earth 
over a week ago. Is that what you 
wanted to know?” 

“You’re off your rocker your- 
self. Larry was perfectly sane 
when I saw him just over two 



months ago. It takes two boards 
three months apart for misfit 
classification.” 

“Not,” Matthews said softly, 
“for classification 3-K.” 

“3-K? What in hell is that?” 

“Organized activities against 
the Stated” 

“Larry? Don’t be funny!” 

“Tell me,” Matthews said, 
“what do you know about the 
Earth?” 

“Ordinary general knowledge. 
That when the Third Atomic 
War broke out on Earth, the colo- 
nies on the Moon and here on 
Mars declared their neutrality. 
The technical staffs on the Earth 
bases for the most part pulled 
out to join them; those that didn’t 
presumably got submerged in the 
holocaust. The state of the war 
was followed by wireless until the 
last transmitter went off the air, 
marking the breakdown. The col- 
onies concentrated on their own 
expansion — first, on the Moon 
and Mars; later, on Venus and 
with the outposts in the Aster- 
oids, and on the moons of Jupiter, 
Saturn and Uranus. There was 
no point in going back to an 
Earth poisoned with radioactive 
gases, with a savage population 
rotted by radiation diseases. The 
obvious thing was to expand out- 
ward, toward other solar sys- 
tems.” 

“And, of course,” Matthews 
said, “there was the Protocol.” 



THE DROP 



121 




T HE Protocol, I suppose, could 
be called the basis of our 
education — that the old and out- 
worn should be put behind; that 
Man should go on to greater 
things, never turning back to the 
world of misery and wretchedness 
to which he had for so long been 
confined. There was a lot more,- 
but that was the gist of it. Chil- 
dren learned it by heart. 

“Yes, the Protocol,” I said. 
“The Protocol rose naturally 
enough out of the circumstances.” 
“Out of the circumstances,” 
Matthews agreed. “But circum- 
stances change. The Protocol re- 
mains the same.” 

“Why shouldn’t it?” 

“Well, grubbing around from 
one artificial environment to an- 
other — do you think that’s the 
best existence men can have? 
Turning our backs on an unbe- 
lievably fruitful planet?” 

“It’s only a temporary phase. 
The Sirius project—” 

“ — is a failure,” Matthews cut 
in. “We won’t be told about that 
officially until a new project has 
been got going — another carrot in 
front of the donkey. But it’s a 
failure. Two planets, neither one 
habitable or capable of being 
made habitable.” 

I said slowly: “Now perhaps 
you will tell me just what all this 
has to do with Larry Gains.” ' 
Matthews got up and walked 
across to the telescreen. He 



touched a small switch on the j 
left-hand side, and the screen • 
moved into patterns of whorls i 
spreading out from the center. I l 

recognized it for a watcher- J 

alarm: if anyone were tapping 
the room, the whorls would be j 
irregular and broken. Matthews 1 
came back and sat down again. j 
“Gains had a lot of time on 
his hands after his crackup. He | 
-got to thinking things over. He 
happened to meet someone in | 
our group. To put it shortly, he j 
joined us.” 1 

"Your group? Joined you? Who J 
are you?” 

“We represent a party whose 
objective is to overthrow the Pro- 
tocol. We want to get back to j 
Earth, to recolonize it and re- '■£ 
claim it from savagery. Gains 1 
came in with us.” § 

“You’re crazy! What makes I 
you think you know better than v 
the Directorate? We’re improving | 
conditions on the planets every p 
year. Why, the new bubble up 
the Long Canal takes in over 
forty square kilometers!” 

“Bigger bubbles,” Matthews 
said, “but always bubbles. Never 
the chance to live a natural life 
in natural surroundings.” 

“And Larry? You let him get 
caught?” 

“It was bad luck.” 

“Bad luck?” 

“He and another of our group 
had their conversation tapped. 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



They were both taken. Fortu- 
nately, neither of them knew 
more than a couple of other peo- 
ple in the group, and those two 
people got away. We couldn’t do 
anything for Gains and Bessemer. 
They were held strictly incom- 
municado.” 

“So he’s really gone. You're 
sure they’re not still holding him 
somewhere?” 

“On some points our informa- 
tion is definite. They’ve been 
dropped all right. On the North 
American continent — that’s the 
usual place they drop misfits.” 

S OMETHING had been wor- 
rying me all along, and sud- 
denly I knew what it was. 

I said warily: “Well, I’ve got 
the information I came in search 
of. Now I’m beginning to wonder 
why I got it. I don’t imagine you 
thought I would be a cinch for 
your organization just because 
Larry had been in it, did you? 
And yet you’ve told me a lot 
which you can’t be in the habit 
of passing out casually. What’s 
behind it?” 

“Well, we haven’t told you any- 
thing the Directorate doesn’t 
know,” Matthews said evenly. 
“Except that I’m in it, and I 
have my means of getting away; 
in any case, I’m expendable. But 
you’re correct in thinking there 
was a reason. Gains was a good 
friend of yours.” 



“The best.” 

“He was a good man. We didn’t 
want to lose him, and we’d like 
to get him back.” 

“Back? From Earth?” 

“We have a small cruiser at 
our disposal that is confiden- 

tial and I’ve burned both your 
boats and ours by telling you — 
and we can get down to the Earth 
and back again. It isn’t easy, and 
of course there can be no question 
of organizing search parties. But 
if someone else were dropped, 
with instructions for- Gains and 
Bessemer as to a spot to go to to 
•be picked up, all three could be 
taken off. We’re lucky that mis- 
fits are always dropped in more 
or less the same area. It means 
finding them is made easier for 
us. It might be possible.” 

“What’s known about condi- 
tions in that part of the planet?” 
Matthews looked at me levelly. 
“Not a thing.” 

I paused. “All right, I’ll go. 
How?” 

Matthews smiled. “I thought 
you would. As for going — that’s 
easy. You intended to drop in at 
the Terminal Office. Do that. If 
you are persistent, they’ll inform 
you about Gains. After that, it’s 
easy. You will be under auto- 
matic examination at the Office, 
and the shot of adrenalin you 
will take before you go over there 
will register. You will be pulled 
in on suspicion. Certain papers 



THE DROP 



123 




will have been planted in your 
things at the Club. From that 
point on, things will be straight- 
forward. All we have to do is just 
hope that when they verify you 
again, they keep a reasonable dis- 
tance from suspicion of what’s 
really happening. I think they 
will. Verifiers aren’t very good 
nowadays.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “You seem 
to have everything well worked 
out. Just as a matter of interest, 
that remark about burning both 
my boats and yours — if I hadn’t 
volunteered for this, what would 
you have done?” 

“We were fairly sure of you,” 
Matthews said. “But if we had 
been wrong . 

He turned his thumb down 
very regretfully. 

T WAS surprised how quickly 
the proceedings were rushed 
through. The papers Matthews 
had had planted in my gear must 
have been very incriminating. I 
was transferred to the Moon, to 
Archimedes Crater, for the final 
decision, but it was cut-and-dried 
beforehand. Within a week of my 
conversation with Matthews, I 
was standing in front of the 
Board, listening to myself being 
pronounced a misfit and con- 
demned to the drop back to 
Earth. I was marched out. 

Someone was waiting for me 
in an anteroom. It was Pinski. 



I said: “I’ve been verified three 
times in a week. I’d never have 
thought you would have needed 
any more.” 

Pinski smiled. “This time it’s 
different. You have a compulsory 
total recall to go through.” 

“You can’t do that. Regulation 
75 states that no one can be put 
under a form of interrogation 
that his conscious mind cannot 
observe. The Verifier is the limit.” 
“You know the regulation,” 
Pinski said, “ex-Captain New- 
sam. Unfortunately, they don’t 
apply to you any longer. The 
State has cast you out. This won’t 
take very long.” 

So much, I though grimly, for 
Matthews’ sources of informa- 
tion. There was nothing I could 
do now. I could resist, but that 
would only mean being put into 
an arodate paralysis. 

“Sit down,” Pinski said. 

The little silver balls began to 
revolve ; the mirrors gleamed with 
strange lights. I heard Pinski’s 
voice, close at first, and then 
from greater and greater echoing 
distances. 

After an indefinite space of 
time, Pinski’s voice again: 
“Wake up, Newsam. Wake up.” 
I raised my head, my mind 
clear. Pinski was looking at me 
commiseratingly. 

“You’Ve had tough luck,” he 
observed. “They certainly roped 
you in.” 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I wasn’t sure how much they 
had got from me, though I 
guessed it would be everything. 

“I’m not complaining,” I said. 

“There’s no provision for re- 
classifying misfits, I’m sorry to 
say. If there were, we might have 
saved you. As it is . you can 
take the drop in the satisfaction 
that you’ve done the Directorate 
a final service. We didn’t know 
about that cruiser.” He paused. 
“The boat’s outside. Good luck, 
Newsam.” 

We shook hands. The guards 
took me outside, through the lock 
to the Main Ramp. I had a last 
look at Archimedes, spread 
squatly around under its glisten- 
ing bubble, and went through into 
the boat — a light coracle. 

During the takeoff and the 
three-hour journey toward Earth, 

I had time to consider things. 
Matthews’ little scheme had been 
nicely blown up. When the cruiser 
arrived at the rendezvous that 
had been arranged, there would 
be a handy battle fleet waiting 
for it. What fools they were, any- 
way, to attempt to outwit the 
Directorate! As for resettling the 
Earth ... I had the job of doing 
it on my own now, with the aid 
of Larry and this fellow Besse- 
mer — if I could find them at all. 

I I ’HE coracle dropped into an 

orbit, and they made the final 
arrangements for the drop. Mat- 



thews had been right, at least, in 
saying that they didn’t drop mis- 
fits at random. The whole thing 
was meticulously calculated. 
When they finished, I was fitted 
up in the dropsuit. 

The captain of the coracle, a 
small, morose fellow, gave me in- 
structions. 

“The five retard jets will fire 
‘automatically. After the fifth, the 
first parachute comes into action, 
and ten seconds later the second.” 
He grinned sadly. “If nothing has 
happened after fifteen seconds, 
you’ll know something has gone 
wrong in the packing. You’ll 
smash flat in that case, killed 
outright. You’ll feel no pain what- 
ever.” 

“Thanks,” I said. 

“We’ve never had any com- 
plaints before, but then I suppose 
we wouldn’t. The spot you are to 
hit is the place we always send 
misfits. Out of the generosity of 
the Directorate, it’s good hunting 
ground and, if you survive long 
enough, you can probably even 
farm it. Within easy reach of the 
ocean, too. Used to be called New 
Hampshire.” 

“Any provisions?” 
“Concentrated food for a week. 
And a Klaberg pistol with a hun- 
dred rounds. I’d look after them 
if I were you — which I’m glad 
I’m not, incidentally.” 

They eased me out of the lock 
with stopwatch timing. I didn’t 



THE DROP 



125 




wait for the airblast to pi’sh me 
clear; I sprang off myself. As I 
did so, the clearance jet pushed 
behind me. Tumbling over and 
over in space, I saw the coracle 
shrink behind me like a deflating 
balloon. I was on my own now 
with a vengeance. 

Just after the fifth retard jet, 
a thought struck me and sent a 
prickling apprehension down my 
spine. Matthews had failed to 
anticipate the compulsory total 
recall. What if he and his group 
were wrong in another minor de- 
tail? There might have been more 
than a gruesome jest in the Cap- 
tain’s remark about the second 
parachute not opening. 

Who would know if the drop 
ended in death? Might not the 
Directorate feel that so swift an 
end was only merciful? 

The first parachute opened with 
a jerk, and I began counting, 
slowly, in my head. 

At fifteen, I knew I was right. 
I was plunging down faster and 
faster through the thin air. Death 
was below me. 

At twenty, with a heaving jerk, 
the main parachute opened. The 
Captain’s sense of humor had 
been even more gruesome than I 
imagined. 

Still, untrained as I was for this 
kind of thing, I hit the ground 
hard. Rolling over, I hit my head 
against something and I went out, 
thinking, just as I blanked, that 



I was getting tired of being un- 
conscious. 

B EFORE my eyes opened 
again, I heard Larry’s voice. 
I thought of it as a hallucination, 
but it was a remarkably persis- 
tent one. 

“Come on, Jake, you’re all 
right now.” 

I opened my eyes. It was Larry. 
Stranger yet, there were half a 
dozen people behind him. And 
two of them were women. 

“I was to have found you and 
taken you to a place up on the 
coast, for a cruiser to take us off,” 
I told him miserably. “But the 
Directorate knows about it. The 
whole thing’s a trap.” 

Larry laughed. “It’s a trap, 
sure enough, but the Directorate 
hasn’t got it quite right.” 

“I’m serious,” I insisted. “They 
got it from me under total recall.” 
“We knew that,” Larry said. 
“Matthews couldn’t warn you of 
it, of course, or the warning itself 
would have shown up. So there 
had to be another story — one that 
would convince you, and throw 
the Directorate off the scent at 
the same time.” 

“How do you know all this?” 
“We haven’t got a cruiser,” 
Larry said. “We haven’t even got 
a coracle. But we do have wire- 
less communication. We were 
waiting for you. We always are 
waiting for misfits.” 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





“We?” I asked. 

“We have a nice little colony 
here. Fifty-eight of us, and still 
growing.” 

They had been helping me out 
of the dropsuit. I felt a breeze on 
my face, and the smell, the inde- 
scribable smell, of natural air 
laden with a dozen different 
scents of flowers and grass and 
trees. Larry was watching me. 
“It’s really something, isn’t it?” 
“What about the savages?” 

He shrugged. “There may be 
some to the west. We haven’t had 
time to lopk properly. But this 
country’s clear.” 

There was soft turf beneath my 
feet. 

“But why?" I asked. “The Di- 
rectorate must know what this 
planet is like. Why don’t they" 
move back, instead of fumbling 
around with interstellar projects 
that never get anywhere?” 

“The Directorate is an organi- 
zation designed to rule a set of 
neatly controlled artificial cities 
— a state spread out over nearly 
a dozen planets and satellites, but 
an entirely urban state. If men 
came back to Earth, came back 
to farm the land, living in vil- 
lages as we do now, the Direc- 
torate’s power would be broken. 
If you want any more reasons, 
you just don’t know enough about 
human nature.’* 

“And can we beat them?” I 
asked him. “Can we defy them

under their very noses? With the 
Tycho telescope trained on the 
Earth, inspecting everything?” 

“We don’t want to beat any- 
body,” Larry said. “We’re satis- 
fied to escape notice. The village 
is made of small, scattered build- 
ings, and even then they are cam- 
ouflaged to make them harder to 
spot. We farm our land, and our 
agents on the planets pick our 
recruits.” 

“Matthews,” I exclaimed sud- 
denly. “Poor devil-s— he’s still at 
Forbeston!” ■ 



“You’ll see him shortly. He’s 
due to be arrested within three 
months.” 

He laughed and the rest of the 
small party with him. I saw the 
joke myself, and began laughing 
almost uncontrollably. Larry put 
an arm on my shoulder. 

“Take a look at that,” he said. 
“Take a good look.” 

I looked and saw the sunset. 
It was glowing through clean, 
pure air instead of a bubble or a 
viewport.

threatening to snap the thin At- 
lantic lifeline. Supersonics looked 
promising, but that was a little- 
known Reid in which researchers 
had to start from the very bottom. 
Not far away, as Galactic dis- 
tances go, the people of Sumanor 
on the planet they called Urish 
could have told the Allied coun- 
cillors everything about super- 
sonics. It would have been a fair 
exchange, for on Urish they had 
never heard of submarines. 

A D. 2275: The rangy blond 
man with the somewhat 
improbable name of Au- 
chinleck Welcome stepped off the 
sidewalk and strode across the 
springy, semi-living warmth of 
the floor toward the arched gate- 
way. Suitably dignified flame-let- 
ters danced above it to spell out: 

BUREAU OF INTERCUI.TURAI. EXCHANGE 
Technical Division 

But some light-hearted soul 
had painted a horse on the door 
and Welcome, not one to stand 
on dignity, had allowed it to re- 
main; His office was known from 
Mercury to Minerva as the Horse 
Traders. He was willing to agree 
that the description was apt. 

The door opened for him and 
he walked through the outer of- 
fice, nodding to the clerks and 
secretaries at the computers, tape- 
files, dictoscribes, and the rest of 



the complex office paraphernalia. 
A few bars of Waltzing Matilda 
whistled between his teeth as he 
entered the inner suite. The re- 
ceptionist smiled at his greeting 
and he went by her and through 
the office of his private secretary, 
Christine Ernenek. 

“ ‘Morning,” he said, pausing. 
Despite all the years he had spent 
in space, there was still a hint of- 
Australian twang in his speech. 
‘‘How’s life?” 

“Just fine, Auch,” the Green- 
lander answered. “I think you 
have a busy day lined up.” 

“Who’s first?” 

She glanced at her memotab. 
“The little duck from Arcturus. 
Robotics, you know. Have you 
seen him yet?” 

“No, too busy. He’ll have been 
going through the usual process- 
ing first, anyway.” Welcome sigh- 
ed. “When will Health get it 
through their heads that Man 
hasn’t caught an extraterrestrial 
disease yet?” 

“There’s always the first time, 
Auch. And then the diplomats 
and so on have to see him. He is 
a sort of ambassador, after all.” 

“I know, I know.” Welcome 
nodded impatiently and fumbled 
out a battered corncob pipe and 
began stuffing it. Christine had 
been in the office longer than he; 
he’d only been given the job a 
month ago, because of his engi- 
neering work on Freyja. A flicker 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of eagerness kindled in him. “This 
robotics stuff may turn out to be 
one of our biggest hauls.” 

“Maybe so.” Christine giggled. 
“He’s cute, that duck.” Glancing 
at the tab again : “Then, of course, 
you’re still negotiating with Vega, 
Sirius and Procyon. Oh, yes, and 
a Centaurian.” 

“What?” Welcome almost 
dropped his pipe. 

“A Centaurian. Alpha A III, 
from the clan of Brogu, continent 
of Almerik, name of Helmung. 
He wants spaceships and atomic 
energy in exchange for witch- 
craft.” 

“Oh, no!” 

“The main office said for you 
to see him, anyway. He seems to 
have special abilities — Well, 
you’ll find out.” Christine grinned 
with friendly malice. “Good 
luck.” 

W ELCOME shrugged and 
went on into his own office. 
You had to take the bad with the 
good, he supposed. There had, 
been the tentacled monster from 
Van Maanen’s Star who had 
grown very indignant on learning 
that Earth didn’t care to trade 
the null-null drive for a system 
of astrology which, taking Galac- 
tic drift into account, was guar- 
anteed infallible. But aetainst that 
you had to balance the Zarbadian 
selective-killing process; witn a 
little more work, that device 



should be able to annihilate any 
disease germ just by putting the 
patient under a force generator. 
And at the present moment, the 
envoys from Procyon and Vega — 
possibly the one from Arcturus, 
too— were carrying portfolios 
which meant revolutionary tech- 
nological advances for Earth. 

When it took more than four 
years objective time to reach even 
the nearest star — however short 
the interval was subjectively for 
those on board the spaceship — 
the traditional cargoes became 
valueless. No mineral, no materi- 
al treasure whatever, was worth 
the cost of such hauling. Nor was 
there any special reason these 
days for humans to emigrate. 
But the intangibles of knowledge 
— that was another matter. You 
could well afford to spend a few 
megacredits and decades, if it 
meant learning a technology your 
race might not otherwise master 
for a thousand years. 

And Earth had the only inter- 
cultural clearing house in the Gal- 
axy. They still have to come to 
us, even if we are the ones who 
haul them here and back. I just 
park myself and wait. 

Welcome sat down, feeling the 
sensuous flow of the chair as it 
modeled itself to his angular con- 
tours, and let his eyes rove the 
office. It was a big room, taste- 
fully decorated in the Neoflam- 
boyant style, a broad window

opening on the jagged view of 
Luna beyond the dome. It was 
near dawn, there was a glare on 
the highest peaks shouldering 
above the horizon, but Earth still 
dominated a heaven full of stars. 
He glanced at the planet, think- 
ing of his family in Sydney. They 
were visiting there. It wasn’t fair ' 
to children, keeping them on 
Luna all the time; they ought to 
have some sea and open sky. 

Well, work to do. 

A RCTURUS — Two planets 
with intelligent natives, of 
which only one group had more 
than a primitive technology, 
Welcome recalled. Those were a 
friendly race, anxious to please, 
and the three expeditions there 
had all returned quite excited 
about the cybernetic advances of 
the leading nation. So now the 
Arcturian ducks had come to 
swap horses. Welcome decided 
that he would get some rather 
low-pressure salesmanship; after 
all, the Arcturians couldn’t be 
sure how much humanity already 
knew, and they were not an agres- 
sive breed. 

Still, when you met a people 
who weren’t human to begin 
with, and had a different cultural 
pattern to boot, you never knew 
what to expect. That was the 
reason for the informal basis on 
which the Horse Traders were 
allowed to operate, and their 



chief’s nearly absolute power to 
drive bargains. But God help 
him if he made a mistake! 

Christine’s voice came over the 
intercom, jarring him to full 
awareness: “The envoy Rappapa 
of Kwillitch, planet Arcturus V, 
to see you, Freeman Welcome.” 
There was a confused noise in 
the background, and he thought 
her voice held an uncontrollable 
laughter. 

“Send him in, please.” 

Welcome stood up as the door 
opened. Since notions of courtesy 
varied fantastically from world 
to world, he had decided to stick 
by Terrestrial conventions. 

“HUP-two-three-four! HUP- 
two-three-four! HUP-two-three- 
four!” 

Welcome thought briefly and 
wildly that he must be dreaming. 
A small regiment of dolls was en- 
tering his office. 

No, not dolls — robots, shiny 
humanoid robots five inches high. 
They goosestepped in perfect 
marching order, swinging their 
arms in unison, accompanied by 
tanks and helicopters built to 
scale. Behind them, quacking his 
shrill commands, was the Arctu- 
rian. He was of ostrichlike shape, 
some four feet tall, blue-feather- 
ed arid crested; instead of wings, 
he had skinny four-fingered arms 
carrying a large box, and his 
head was big and round, pop- 
eyed, with a flexible bill.

“HUP-two-three-four! HUP- 
Two-three-four! Com-pan-ee — 
HALT! Ri-i-ight— FACE! Pre- 
sent— ARMS!” 

T HE toy soldiers halted, wheel- 
ed, and snapped to attention. 
A helicopter buzzed watchfully 
over Welcome’s head. It was 
about the size of a pigeon. 

“How do you do, how do you 
do, noble sir?” The Arcturian 
bowed, touching the floor with 
his beak. “I trust that you in 
splendid health find yourself?” 
“Yes,” said Welcome faintly. 
“Excuse me while I pick up my 
jaw.” 

“If I your excellency’s magnifi- 
cent jaw have caused to fall, it is 
to be of the most apologetic,” 
said the Arcturian unhappily. 

“Never mind,” said Welcome. 
“Please sit down, Freeman Rap- 
papa. If you wish to,” he added 
hastily; he couldn’t remember 
whether this particular species 
sat or not. 

“If you will it of indifference 
find, I will stand in the luminous 
presence of your excellency,” said 
Rappapa. “Among my greetings- 
to-you-conveying folk, only nest- 
ing females sit.” 

“I — well, do you ■ smoke?” 
Welcome extended a box of cig- 
ars. 

“You are to be magnificently 
thanked,” said Rappapa, accept- 
ing one. “ Whichuwaki /” One of 



the helicopters swooped down 
and shot out a flame to light it 
for him. 

Welcome seated himself. “I 
take it those are robots.” 

“Of a most humble sort, for 
demonstration purposes alone,” 
said Rappapa. “They are power- 
ed by radiation from this control 
box here, as your excellency is 
undoubtedly aware. The brain 
circuits are also herein contained. 
Each machine has its individual 
brain, controlling the external 
body, or any number of brains 
can be joined in series to produce 
higher effectiveness.” 

W ELCOME forced himself to 
be impassive. Inwardly, his 
heart leaped. If the Arcturians 
could make a cybernetic setup 
that compact, what couldn't they 
do? 

“May I afjd they can act at 
individual discretion, within the 
limits of their basic directives?” 
said Rappapa eagerly. “Possibly 
toys or household servants for 
your superb people?” 

“It seems to me that a house 
could be built to do everything 
itself, without needing a special 
robot,” said Welcome. 

“Of a most suredly! These, as 
I say, are illustrative only. It has 
insignificantly occurred to me 
that your splendid spaceships 
could be given brains of their 
own, eliminating .necessity for

• crews on those so-long voyages.” 
“To be sure, Freeman Rappa- 
pa. And control and communica- 
tions in general — you can doubt- 
less show us a great deal we don’t 
know.” 

“It is of a strangeness that you, 
who so daringly bridged the stars, 
have not surpassed us in this 
humble endeavor.” 

“Well, it’s not so odd, really.” 
Welcome rekindled his pipe. 
“Many things determine the 
technological progress of a cub 
ture: social need and demand, 
the general background of know- 
ledge and tradition, the ability of 
individual researchers within a 
given field — sheer accident, tod, 
I suppose. My race has gone 
furthest in developing transporta- 
tion and energy sources. Your 
people stayed on their planet, but 
instead have gone in primarily 
for robots, automata, computers 
— cybernetics. On Procyon A III, 
they’re super -biologists, especial- 
ly in the line of controlled genet- 
ics, but lack atomic energy. And 
so on throughout the Galaxy. It 
would be strange if the history of 
any one race had caused it to ex- 
cel in everything.” 

“I am blinded by the clarity 
of your explanation. Sir, dare I 
hope that you will find our little 
skill worthy of consideration?” 
“Indeed you may,” said Wel- 
come. “Was there anything in 
particular you would like to have 



from us, or do you first want to 
see what we can offer?” 

“Your incredible process for 
obtaining atomic energy from the 
disintegration of any matter 
whatsoever would prostrate us of 
Kwillitch with joy.” 

r | iHE human rubbed his chin. 

That was certainly a reason- 
able enough asking price. In fact, 
his conscience hurt him a bit. 

“I think that can be agreed on,” 
he said blandly. “You have, of 
course, brought specialized as- 
sistants, and plans and textbooks 
and so on, from which our people 
can learn what you have to teach 
them? Good. Then you should 
designate some of your people to 
study our energy -conversion tech- 
niques. The new hypnopedic 
system will make it possible for 
both sides to learn these things 
rather fast. Of course, it isn’t 
quite that simple. One can’t in- 
troduce a new science into a vac- 
uum. For example, being told all 
about nuclear disintegration isn’t 
going to help you unless you al- 
ready know something about 
magnetronics. I’ll give you a gen- 
eral outline of the course, and 
would like you to prepare a sim- 
ilar outline dealing with cyber- 
netics, just so each side can know 
exactly what it is the other has 
to offer. Then the final agreement 
can be made and we can proceed 
to teach each other.”

“That is a scheme of the slyest 
magnanimity,” said Rappapa 
with innocent enthusiasm. 

“Excellent.” Welcome slouched 
farther back in his chair and went 
on to social matters. How did the 
Arcturian party like the quarters 
which had been prepared for 
them here in the dome? The food 
and gravity and air-conditioning 
were satisfactory? They were en- 
joying themselves? Tours of 
Earth would be arranged for 
them — everything to make the 
guests from afar feel at home. 

And to disarm them, make 
them more receptive to our sug- 
gestions. Welt, why not? When 
the future of entire planets is in- 
volved, naivete would be criminal. 

Rappapa was charmed and 
quacked eloquent praises. His 
party had already seen a good 
deal of the dome, met the other 
extraterrestrials currently there, 
been lavishly entertained. 

Welcome nodded. There was 
certainly no rule against the dif- 
ferent embassies having contact 
and perhaps driving their own 
bargains independently of Earth. 

As a matter of fact, such a deal 
was going on right now. The Sir- 
ian knowledge of nucleonics had 
turned out to be inferior to 
Earth’s, but the Vegan represen- 
tative — who had come alone — 
was willing to trade- some of his 
high-pressure chemistry for it. 

Welcome didn’t care very 
much, since he could always get 



the chemistry from Vega in ex- 
change for something else — or | 
even from Sirius, perhaps. Once 
a planet — or nation, tribe, clan, 
individual — -had bought a tech- 
nology, it was their own business 
what they did with it. A Horse 
Trader operated between all par- 
ties, playing both ends against - 
the middle. ) 

“/"'WN a lower plane than your 
excellency, I think — ” 

Rappapa was interrupted by 
the buzzing of the intercom. Wel- 
come flipped the switch and 
Christine shouted half hysterical- 
ly: “No, you can’t go in there. 
He’s busy — Auch, look out! The g 
Sirian — ” { 

There was a thunderous crash - 
on the door. Rappapa squawked ; 
and made a Lunar-gravity leap 
to cower behind his regiment. 
The door flew open and Thevo- 
rakz of Dzuga, Dominator from 
Sirius A IV, stalked in, waving 
his arms and roaring. 

He was a centauroid, with a 
quadrupedal gray body and a 
lashing tail. The upper torso, 
swathed in a black robe and 
cowl, was almost human; a brist- 
ling white walrus mustache con- 
cealed the fact that he had no 
chin. Under a forest of brow, his 
ruby eyes glared fire, and his ears 
twitched and his hoofs stamped 
ominously. 

“You!” he bellowed. “You low 
thiefing monthter! You thcum! I

You dominated! I do not like 
you!” 

Welcome got up, grateful for 
the expanse of desk between him 
and the newcomer. “What’s the 
matter, Dominator Thevorakz?” 
fie tried hard to keep his voice 
level. 

“I thpit my cud on you!” roar- 
ed Thevorakz. “I foul your floor! 
I go home to Thiriuth and come 
back with an army!” 

Christine squeaked in the door- 
way and sprang aside for the 
envoy from Vega VII. The 
gleaming six-foot sphere rolled 
slowly in on its wheels, laying a 
mechanical hand on Thevorakz’s 
rump, and the viewer swiveled 
toward Welcome. It looked un- 
comfortably like a gun. 

Inside, breathing hydrogen and 
ammonia at a pressure of incal- 
oulable atmospheres, the monster 
known only as George was staring 
at the human. His force-filled 
generator hummed in a sudden 
crackling silence; if it ever quit, 
the vehicle would blow up like 
a gigantic bomb and scatter the 
dome from here to Copernicus. 

It had been a long, difficult, 
and expensive proposition to con- 
tact the natives of New Jupiter 
and get one of them to make the 
trip, but living under such con- 
ditions, they had learned things 
about high-pressure chemistry 
which men had never imagined. 
They wanted atomic energy and 



control circuits in exchange. The 
first they had gotten from Sirius, 
the second they had intended to 
get frpm Earth. 

Only — 

ELCOME swallowed uneas- 
ily and put indignation into 
his voice. “May I ask the mean- 
ing of this intrusion? You know 
very well that I am in conference 
with the freeman from Arcturus.” 

“That amorakz!” shouted the 
Sirian. “Dithmith him!” 

“Help!” wailed Rappapa. His 
robots formed a hollow square 
about him. 

“Calmness, please.” George’s 
Voder voice was flat. “I think, 
Freeman Welcome, you know 
very well why we have come.” 

“No, I don’t.” 

“You do tho!” roared Thevo- 
rakz. 

“I shall detail the matter,” 
said George. “The Sirian group 
and I reached a bargain, and I 
educated them as agreed. Nat- 
urally, there were many technical 
data which it would be pointless 
to memorize, formulas and con- 
stants and the like, and I gave 
them a book of tables. Those 
tables are the main thing of value 
which I had to offer, since the

chemistry is already known to

door and looked helplessly at 
Welcome. 

“Now what?” 

“Now we get to work. Get me 
Captain M’Gamba.” 

W HEN the police chief’s dark 
face was on the screen. Wel- 
come explained the situation. 

M’Gamba frowned. “Bad busi- 
ness, huh?” 

“This is not a Good Thing,” 
quoted Welcome. “You can see 
the spot we’re in. If that book 
isn’t recovered fast, we’re going 
to lose face everywhere in the 
whole Galaxy. Earth will be 
branded as a planet of thieves 
and nobody will care to come 
here to do his Horse Trading. 
Sirius could take the lead away 
from us on that, and you know 
what an arrogant, opinionated lot 
they are. Nice people to have as 
the leading race of our new inter- 
stellar culture!” 

“Maybe they did this job 
themselves, just to discredit us?” 



“I wouldn’t put it past ’em. 
But get busy, will you? You 
know the line- — be tactful, but 
just as firm as you dare. And, 
Captain M’Bamba, if we don’t 
settle this affair quick, you and 
I are both going to be looking for 
new jobs.” 

“And good jobs aren’t easy to 
find these days. All right, Free- 
man Welcome, we’ll blast off on 
it right away. I’ll call you as soon 
as I have a report.” 

Welcome gave Christine a hag- 
gard look. She ran a hand 
through her blue-black hair and 
regarded him sympathetically. 
“Tojjgh luck, Auch.” 

“For me or for Earth?” he 
asked bitterly. 

“You, mostly.” Her eyes widen- 
ed. “You don’t think this could 
— lead to war, do you?” 

“Oh, no. The logistics of inter- 
stellar warfare and conquest are 
ridiculous. But it could lead to 
bad relations with our Galactic 
neighbors.” Welcome knocked 
the dottle from his pipe and be- 
gan recharging it. “And you 
know, Chris, this new culture de- 
veloping with the null-null drive 
is an abstract thing, an exchange 
of information and sympathy, 
ideas, philosophies — abstracts, 
not tangibles. Ill feeling now 
could poison it at the source. I 
don’t know. I just don’t know.” 
He stared moodily out at 
Earth.

M ’GAMBA’S report came in a 
couple of hours later, and 
Welcome frowned as he fitted it 
into the pattern of knowledge he 
already had. 

There were a dozen adjoining 
suites on the fourth sub-level of 
the dome, adjustable .to the con- 
ditions of other planets, and the 
same level held three large club- 
rooms for the use of guests. Cur- 
rently, the apartments housed the 
envoys of five stars: Sirius, Vega, 
Arcturus, Procyon, and Alpha 
Centauri. All these groups had 
been on Luna for periods ranging 
from several days to three weeks, 
and had mingled freely in mutual 
curiosity. Last night the dome’s 
chief, Carlos Petersen, had 
thrown one of his periodic par- 
ties for the guests, and all had 
attended. The Sirians had come 
home late and gone directly to 
sleep, not noticing that their . 
place was robbed until they woke 
up the next “morning." 

Whoever did the burglary had 
been confoundedly clever. There 
was an electronic lock, supposed- 
ly burglar-proof, on the outer 
door of the suite, wired to sound 
an alarm if anyone tried to break 
it. It had been opened with no 
trouble at all. The thief had en- 
tered, cut into the strongbox with 
an energy torch, taken the book, 
and walked out again, locking the 
door behind him. 

Welcome scowled. The tech- 



nique of fooling an electronic lock 
was something beyond the science 
of Earth. 

Of course, Thevorakz himself, 
or one of his underlings, might 
have raided the box and hidden 
tlfe book. 

“The torch could have been 
taken from any of the workshops 
on the fifth sub-level,” said 
M’Gamba over the screen. 
“They’re open all the time, you 
know, for the use of anyone who 
has to build a model or something. 
The thief need only have taken 
the torch, used it, and returned 
it when nobody was around. But 
what gadget did he have to un- 
lock that door?” 

“A key, maybe,” suggested 
Welcome. 

“But Thevorakz has the only 
key to it, except for Petersen’s.” 

“I know. How about the sus- 
pects?” 

“Well, the company was wan- 
dering in; and out of the club- 
rooms all the while the party 
went on; and everybody was 
pretty looped, too, except that 
George creature. In short, nobody 
we’ve talked to can swear that 
any other being was there all 
evening.” 

“Hm-hm. Have you searched 
for the book?” 

“We’re still looking. We’ve re- 
quested permission to search all 
the apartments of our guests. So 
far, only the Arcturians have

waived diplomatic immunity and 
invited us to do so.” 

“Weli, keep plugging, Captain, 
and let me know what turns up.” 
“Will do.” 

A FEW minutes later, Carlos 
Petersen was on the screen, 
demanding to know what the 
trouble was. Welcome sighed and 
broke the news as gently as pos- 
sible. 

“Oh, Lord!” said Petersen. 
“And little blue devils,” agreed 
the Australian. 

“I’d have your seat in a sling 
this moment, Welcome, if it 
weren’t that I have to go to Earth 
immediately,” said Petersen. “I’ll 
be gone a couple of days. When 
I come back, I’ll expect to see 
this mess straightened out.” 
“We’ll try.” Welcome was feel- 
ing too harried by now to care 
for manners. But the fact that he 
wouldn’t have Petersen breathing 
down his neck was a minor mer- 
cy. “M’Gamba’s a good man." 

“He’d better be. I like you, 
Welcome, and think you were 
the right choice for your job. But 
this can develop into something 
too big and nasty for ethics to 
count. If it shows signs of doing 
so, Earth is going to need a 
scapegoat and you may very 
well be it.” Petersen grimaced. 
“If they don’t pick me, instead — 
or both of us.” He glanced at his 
wrist chrono. “Got to run now.

Earth rocket leaves in ten min- 
utes.” 

“Have fun,” said Welcome 
moodily. 

He paced once around the of- 
fice, and threw himself into his 
chair. For a minute he exercised 
the more picturesque parts of his 
vocabulary. 

The intercom interrupted him: 
“The envoy Orazuni of Inya- 
huna, planet Procyon A III, to 
see you, Freeman Welcome.” 

The man blinked. “Oh, yes. He 
did have an appointment, didn’t 
he? Send him in, please.” 

He stood up, composing him- 
self as the Procyonite entered. 

O RAZUNI looked rather like 
someone’s idea of a medieval 
demon. His slim graceful body 
sloped forward, stalking on claw- 
ed feet and counterbalanced by 
the long thick tail. The six-finger- 
ed hands were also clawed, and 
the pointed ears were almost 
winglike in their size. But the 
head, though bald, was handsome 
by human standards, in a high- 
cheeked, sharp-chinned, flat- 
nosed way, and the golden eyes 
were large and luminous and 
beautiful. He wore a light tunic 
and a brilliant scarlet cloak, and 
carried a portfolio under one arm. 

“Good day, Freeman Wel- 
come,” -he said, bowing. He had 
taken better to the hypnopedic 
teaching of English than most 

143 




non-humans, his accent being a 
nearly perfect Bostonian. “I trust 
you are in good health and 
spirits?” 

“More or less,” said Welcome 
wryly. He liked the Procyonite, 
despite the sharp battle of wits 
which had been going on between 
them for days now. “And your- 
self?” 

“Quite well, thank you.” Ora- 
zuni sat down on his tail, bracing 
himself with his rigidly straight 
legs, and accepted the proffered 
cigar. “There seems to have been 
an unfortunate incident last 
night.” 

“Yes, rather. Have you any 
notion — ?” 

Orazuni shrugged delicately. 
“One prefers not to become in- 
volved in such matters. I would 
not throw baseless accusations 
about. My group has, however, 
decided to show good faith by 
permitting the searching of our 
quarters. I shall so notify the po- 
lice.” 

“Thank you. The more coop- 
eration we get, the sooner we’ll be 
able to clear this up.” Welcome 
grinned. “I wish you were as easy 
to deal with in the line of busi- 
ness, Freeman Orazuni.” 

“I regret the impression,” 
smiled Orazuni, “but I have my 
own planet to think of.” He open- 
ed the portfolio and took out a 
sheet covered with an elaborate 
diagram. “Here, sir, is the struc- 



tural formula — on a genetic rath- 
er than a chemical basis — of the 
human X chromosome, as deter- 
mined by our technicians since we 
arrived on Luna. We have found 
conclusively that the tendency to 
certain types of cancer in your 
race — mammary, for instance — 
is linked here and here.” He in- 
dicated a point where several 
lines diverged. That was a cluster 
of formulas in the alphabet of 
Inyahuna. “By proper treatment, 
it should be possible to modify 
the linkage without otherwise al- 
tering heredity in the zygote. The 
long-range prospect is the total 
elimination of any possibility of 
cancer from the heredity of your 
race.” 

W ELCOME nodded, unsur- 
prised. What he wanted was 
the knowledge of theoretical and 
applied genetics which made such 
studies possible in the first place. 

Biological engineering — design- 
ing any life-form whatsoever, and 
creating it by controlled muta- 
tion! Perhaps Man himself be- 
coming superman — at the very 
least, losing the inherited weak- 
nesses which dragged him down 
and shadowed his life and ulti- 
mately killed him. This could 
mean more than the scientific 
revolution that began with Gali- 
leo had yet offered. 

Only it hardly seemed fair of 
the Inyahunans to demand every- 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing Earth knew in exchange. 
They were welcome to the null- 
null drive, the energy converter, 
and the magnetronic tube. When 
they also asked for instruction in 
such things as mathematical so- 
ciology, supercomputer theory 
and practice and industrial cata- 
lysis, it was going too far. Their 
culture didn’t need all that in- 
formation. They could only want 
it for purposes of selling to some- 
one else — underselling Earth, 
maybe. Welcome and Orazuni 
had been bargaining for a whole 
week now. 

“We’d have to send a good- 
sized technical mission to Procy- 
on to teach you all this,” said the 
Australian. “It would be hard to 
find enough top-rank men in all 
those fields who’d want to be 
gone so many years on an alien 
planet; we’d have to pay them 
fantastic salaries. And the equip- 
ment they’d need! Really, Free- 
man Orazuni, you must be rea- 
sonable. I think I could add a 
course in advanced metal crystal- 
lography to what I’ve already of- 
fered you. That would help you 
with a good many construction 
problems. But then, naturally, 
we’d want you to give us your 
chemical-probe technique in re- 
turn.” 

“In addition to the genetic 
theory and the tables of con- 
stants?” protested Orazuni. “Do 
you wish to ruin us, Freeman 

HORSE TRADER 



Welcome? What will our poor 
race be able to trade for further 
information?” 

“Your own biological technol- 
ogy. You can’t have worked out 
genetics as thoroughly as you 
have without a good background 
in biochemistry, histology, and 
I don’t know what else.” The hu- 
man put the tips of his' fingers 
together and peered over the 
bridge they formed. “After all, 
we do have some good biologists 
on Earth, too, you know. We 
could work all this out for our- 
selves in time. The very know- 
ledge that such things are pos- 
sible is a long step forward.” 

“As for that,” shrugged Ora- 
zuni gracefully, “we could send 
students to Earth who could con- 
sult your books and journals — ” 

“It would be of limited value 
without the help of men who’ve 
had practical experience,” said 
Welcome. “I’m afraid your peo- 
ple wouldn’t even know what to 
look for.” 

TTE left the rest of it unspoken, 
though it was plain to both 
of them: Now that the civilized 
planets had gotten on to the idea 
of Horse Trading, they weren’t 
going to be particularly coopera- 
tive toward casual students from 
outside. It wasn’t a question of 
censorship; an effective barrier 
was imposed by the fact that 
there was no material trade to 

-- 145 




speak of between the stars. How 
could a visitor pay for his stay 
and education? He had to be 
financed by his hosts. And he 
could only earn such a scholar- 
ship' as a reward for his planet’s 
having offered a similar one to 
the other world. 

They bargained in a gentle- 
manly fashion for a while longer, 
Orazuni dipping into his port- 
folio from time to time — he never 
released it, and there were rumors 
that he slept with it — for some 
tantalizing sample of information. 
Welcome in turn threw out re- 
marks concerning , the value of 
nuclear energy and high-strength 
alloys. The human found himself 
wishing that he knew more about % 
Inyahuna’s culture. They were 
a polite but reserved people — one 
might almost say secretive. 

It went well today, though. 
Orazuni seemed much more ame- 
nable than he had been yester- 
day, and at the close of the 
discussion there was almost com- 
plete agreement. 

“I think we can wind this up 
tomorrow,” said Welcome. “I re- 
peat my offer of throwing in a 
course in quantum theory of res- 
onance bonds as applied to al- 
loys. Think it over.” 

“I must discuss it with my 
group,” replied Orazuni, “but I 
think they will consider the terms 
fair. Frankly, I would like to re- 
turn soon with my wives. Our 

146 



children will be nearly grown by 
the time we get home. If you 
would make arrangements to 
have the Messenger depart in a 
week or so — ” 

“Well, all right.” Welcome bal- 
anced the factors in his mind. 
He’d have to round up all the in- 
structors and other experts he 
had on tap to go to Procyon, 
alert the ship’s people, arrange 
clearance. But a week should be 
enough. The other Inyahunans 
would remain to take posts at one 
of Earth’s universities. “Wouldn’t 
you like to visit around in the 
Solar System for a few months 
first, though? It seems a shame 
for you to come all this way 
without seeing much more than 
Luna.” 

“No, thank you. My people are 
not given to tourism.” Orazuni 
got up to go. “Oh, by the way, if 
you will pardon my returning to 
a painful subject — I am curious. 
What is so unusual about this 
robbery, apart from the circum- 
stances?” 

“Well, the fact that an elec- 
tronic lock was opened. It’s not 
supposed to be possible without a 
key.” As Orazuni arched his hair- 
less brows, Welcome explained: 
“The lock has no keyhole. It’s 
held by a magnetronic field 
clamping two plates together 
with a force of several thousand 
tons, the field being generated by 
the circulation of an electronic 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




current in several Cheval tubes. 
The whole thing is also wired in 
to an alarm circuit which goes 
off at any attempt to tamper. 
The key is actually a self-power- 
ed tube creating a heterodyning 
field. Since a literal infinity of 
wave-combinations is possible, 
there should be no chance of 
anyone’s Using a variable key to 
fumble the lock open.” 

“I see. I thought it was some- 
thing on that order.” Orazuni 
nodded and stroked his chin. “Do 
you know, if the crime was not 
committed by the Sirians them- 
selves — or, if you will pardon me, 
by a human — then it seems log- 
ical that the guilty party should 
have a very advanced knowledge 
of electronics.” 

“I’d say so.” 

“Cybernetics?” murmured Ora- 
zuni. He bowed. “Well, I will not 
intrude further on your time. 
Good day, Freeman Welcome.” 

He left. 

When he was gone, the human 
stood thinking for a long while. 
Small complicated circuits — Arc- 
turus? Rappapa seemed like a 
pleasant little chap, but you nev- 
er knew. 

He sighed and looked out the 
window. The slow Lunar dawn 
was breaking incandescently over 
the jagged airless horizon and 
blazing into his eyes. 

“Nice day,” he muttered bit- 
terly. 



M ’GAMBA called up a few 
minutes later. “We found 
the book,” he said. 

“Eh?” Welcome’s long body 
jerked forward. 

“Lying in a corner of Shop 
Number Seven. Anybody could 
have left it there. We gave it 
back to the Sirians, but they 
weren’t very polite about it.” 
Welcome shrugged. “I don’t 
blame them. Obviously the thief 
took photomicrographs of the 
book and got rid of the thing it- 
self away after he was done with 
it. Now all we have to find is a 
packet consisting of a few one- 
inch-square films. Hell, he could 
have swallowed ’em.” 

“And grabbed himself a whole 
technology without paying Vega 
for it. 4 guess George is hopping 
mad too, though you can’t tell. 
He gives me the crawlies.” 

“The devil with that. We’ve got 
to find the burglar to clear our- 
selves. Been through the apart- 
ments?” 

“All but the Sirians and George. 
The Sirians wouldn’t hear of it, 
and it’d be impossible to make a 
decent search in a place 'condi- 
tioned to New Jupiter. Nothing. 
Not a thing.” 

Welcome bit his lip, then blurt- 
ed out his suspicions of Arcturus. 

The police captain nodded. 
“Sounds pretty reasonable.” 

« “I took Rappapa for a dinkum 
cobber, but — well, we can’t trust

anybody, can we? Rig some 
traps. Try to fluoro him and his 
bunch without their knowing it. 
Go through their suite again with 
an electronic probe. Try any- 
thing.” 

“All jets,” said M’Gamba 
glumly, and clicked off. 

The intercom buzzed. “The en- 
voy Helmung dur Brogu-Almer- 
ik, planet Alpha Centauri A III, 
to see you, Freeman Welcome,” 
said Christine in a mechanical 
voice. 

“On top of everything else,” 
groaned the Australian. “All 
right, send him in.” 

T HE door flew open. A nine- 
foot giant stamped in, thump- 
ing the butt of his spear on the 
floor, his chain mail jangling and 
his sword clanking. He was fairly 
humanoid, except for a blue skin, 
a tail, and antennae above his 
small slant eyes, but the battered 
face was tattooed in a ferocious 
pattern of red and yellow. If it 
hadn’t been for several explora- 
tion parties from Earth, which 
had maintained a more or less 
permanent liaison with the clan 
chief of Brogu, this visit — or visi- 
tation — would never have hap- 
pened. But the barbarians had 
heard news of the Horse Traders 
and insisted on getting into the 
game, and in the interests of 
peace the last expedition had 
brought this delegate back. And 



sloughed him off on me! thought 
Welcome with resentment. 

“How do you do, Freeman Hel- 
mung?” The Earthman said very 
softly. The Centaurian’s head 
looked immensely high above 
him. 

“Quiet, I will speak!” The 
walls rattled. 

“Just as you wish.” Welcome 
extended the customary box of 
cigars. Health hadn’t reported 
this race as allergic to tobacco, 
but he hoped maliciously that 
Helmung would be. 

The giant grabbed a handful, 
popped them into his mouth, and 
chewed noisily. “Not bad,” he 
said, sprawling into a chair. He 
swallowed, spat on the floor, and 
cocked his spurred feet up on the 
desk. “I am Helmung dur Brogu- 
Almerik. Look on me and be 
afraid.” It seemed a ritual greet- 
ing, for he added in a more 
friendly tone: “You may call me 
Skull-smasher.” 

“Ah, yes, to be sure.” Wel- 
come sat down on the other side 
of the desk. “I trust you have 
been enjoying your stay?” 

“Not enough fights. No females 
big enough. That Orazuni, he is 
good sort and gives me much 
drink, otherwise you can hialamar 
them all.” Welcome did not in- 
quire what it was to hialamar, 
though he could make a shrewd 
guess. “I am great sorcerer. I 
have much vingutyr.” 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You have much everything,” 
agreed Welcome hastily. 

“Vingutyr is — is what I have 
much of. That is why I am great 
sorcerer.” The gravelly bass 
paused for a thunderous belch. 
“I shall show you how to wish 
your enemies dead. You shall 
show me how make ships-that- 
fly. Then we shall sack many 
worlds.” 

“Well, really, I say now — ” 
Welcome had a sudden sense of 
futility. “There just isn’t much 
witchcraft on Earth these days.” 
“I knew you was backward 
peoples!” cried Helmung trium- 
phantly. “Look, dance of death, 
begins this way.” He jumped tip, 
waving his spear, and began to 
prance around, chanting. 

“Isn’t there something about 
making a doll and sticking pins 
in it?” asked Welcome weakly. 

“Old-fashioned. Brogu is mod- 
ern peoples. My father, top witch 
in Almerik, study from Earth- 
men. Learn about laws of science. 
He go on to figure laws of witch- 
craft.” Helmung ticked off the 
points on his fingers, and Wel- 
come realized that he must, after 
all, be his race’s equivalent of an 
intellectual. “Law of likes-make- 
likes. Law of luck. Law of — ” 
“Now hold on, please do.” 

W ELCOME riffled through 
his papers till he found the 
memo on Alpha Centauri sub- 



mitted by the preliminary in- 
vestigators, which, in the 
madhouse today, he hadn’t had 
time to read. Confound it, the 
barbarian must have something 
worth the time of a division chief! 
He skimmed rapidly down the 
sheet and stopped at a paragraph 
referring to a limited degree of 
telekinesis as a congenital talent. 
The. phenomenon was almost non- 
existent among humans, and the 
parapsychology boys wanted 
Helmung humored so they could 
study him in detail. 

Welcome thought of the Cen- 
taurian tossing boulders through 
the air by pure will-power, and 
shuddered. f 

“I understand,” he began cau- 
tiously, “that you can move 
things merely by wishing them 
to move.” 

“Well, little things,” said Hel- 
mung deprecatingly. “Not very 
big. Powerful wish-mover back 
home was showed game called 
dice by Earthmen. He won much 
treasure from them. But he had 
be much powerful to move dice.” 

“I see.” 

Welcome suppressed an im- 
pulse to mop his brow. He wasn’t 
very well briefed on modern pa- 
rapsych theory, but he remem- 
bered vaguely that telekinesis 
was attributed to a linkage be- 
tween the neural field and the 
local sub-electronic fluxes. If that 
was so, you wouldn’t expect the 



HORSE TRADER 



149 




nervous system to have enough 
energy output to lift anything 
massive. Still, it would be inter- 
esting to watch. 

“Do you mind if I try you?” 
he asked. “I’ve never seen this 
before.” 

“Is little thing,” said Helmung 
scornfully. “Why not ask me 
wish-kill somebody for you?” 
“Some other time,” said Wel- 
come. He wpnt over to a cabinet 
in which he kept testing equip- 
ment and took out an oscillo- 
scope. When he had a steady sine 
wave on it, he gestured with one 
hand. “Can you change that wig- 
gly shape there?” he asked. 

“Easy,” grunted Helmung. 
“Orazuni told me about little 
things, too small to see.” 

“Yes. As a biologist, he’d nat- 
urally be interested in TK, too. 
Never mind, go ahead, if you 
please.” 

H ELMUNG scowled in con- 
centration. The electron trace 
jerked wildly, slithered across the 
screen, and began shaping itself 
into obscene drawings. Welcome 
hastily shut off the scope. 

“That’s fine,” he said. “That’s 
just beautiful.” 

Helmung rubbed his hands 
with a businesslike air. “Now 
how you build ships-that-fly?” 

“I don’t think you would be 
really interested in that,” said 
Welcome as tactfully as possible. 



Helmung’s tail lashed against 
his ankles. He leaned across the 
desk, grabbed the human by the 
scruff of the neck, lifted him up, 
and shook him. 

“So Brogu witchcraft not good 
enough for you, hah?” 

“Yowp!” Welcome was near 
choking when Helmung set him 
down. 

“I am patient man,” rumbled 
the barbarian, “but you show me 
how build ships, or — ” 

“Now look, Skull-smasher,” 
said Welcome shakily. “Really, 
I’d like to, you know, but I’m not 
the boss here. I can’t tell. you my- 
self. You see — uh — well, on Earth 
our witches still believe in the 
dolls- and-pins theory. Also, to 
build spaceships you’d need tools 
you don’t have, even if you knew 
how. Why don’t you think it 
over for a while? We could show 
you lots of other things. For in- 
stance, you know what an alloy 
is? Well, we can tell you how to 
make better alloys than you now 
have. Unbreakable swords and 
so on. Why not start with that 
and work up?” 

“Might be,” grumbled Hel- 
mung, taking a thoughtful bite 
off another cigar. 

“Oh, and ways to brew fire- 
water, perhaps,” added Welcome. 

He winked, and Helmung guf- 
fawed, and presently the inter- 
view ended in a spirit of good 

fellowship. When the broad mail- 

* • 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ed back had gone out the door, 
Welcome made a dash for a 
three-starred bottle. 

He thumbed the intercom 
switch. 

“Come on in Chris,” he said. “I 
think we both need a drink.” 

r¥lWO hours later, Welcome was 
pretty sure he had tracked 
down the thief. 

The time had been 'devoted to 
hard thinking and to study of the 
files on the four possible planets, 
sent up from the Division of Bio- 
politicology. Four planets, be- 
cause you could eliminate Hel- 
mung immediately, and Welcome 
was sure enough of his own staff 
to feel certain that no human, 
even in a fit of greed or planetar- 
ism, had snaffled the book. Fur- 
thermore, you had to bear in mind 
that none of the delegates could 
have known in advance that a 
theft would be possible. They 
could not have made elaborate 
preparations beforehand for the 
job, but must have used whatever 
means were available to them, 
more nr less on impulse. That 
argued for the burglar’s having 
the technology to pick an elec- 
tronic lock even if he had never 
seen one before. 

That also ruled out Procyon at 
once. Enough was known of their 
science to make it quite certain 
that they lagged behind Earth in 
such matters as control circuits. 



Vega — you couldn’t be sure just 
what George ,did or did not have 
at his disposal, but the fact that 
he had come here in the first place 
to get some of mankind’s elec- 
tronic and magnetronic know- 
ledge pretty well proved that he 
couldn’t have done the crime. 
Why should he steal his own 
book, anyway? New Jupiter 
wasn’t much interested in inter- 
stellar intercourse or in setting 
up its own Horse Traders. 

It was also a safe bet that Sirius 
did not know how to open the 
lock without a key. To be sure, 
Thevorakz did have such an in- 
strument, and he might well have 
faked the crime to discredit Earth 
in the eyes of other races. But 
the psychology reports, while not 
conclusive, did make that line of 
thought seem improbable. The 
Dominators weren’t that subtle. 

By elimination — Arcturus. 

Welcome sighed and called 
M’Gamba’s office. “Anything 
new?” 

“We’re working along,” said 
the policeman. “We’ve had every 
human who was on the fourth 
sub-level last night, at the party 
or on duty elsewhere, under deep 
hypnosis — total recall. By piecing 
together all their accounts, we’ve 
shown that every member of the 
Procyonite and the Arcturian del- 
egations was seen by somebody 
all the time until the party broke 
up and the Sirians went home. 



HORSE TRADER 



151 




In other words, there’s not a 
chance that any of them could 
have done it. There are blank 
spots as far as the rest are con- 
cerned, though.” 

“Arcturus, eh?” Welcome 
frowned. “Do you have anything 
else on them?” 

“Well, we have been snapping 
fluoros at the Arcturian ducks on 
the sly, as you suggested. You 
know those little pouches they 
wear around their necks, to carry 
things in? One of their party — 
Srnapopoi, the name is — is car- 
rying around a packet of micro- 
films. But it can’t be the film, 
can it?” 

“Can’t it?” Welcome showed 
his teeth in a humorless grin. 
“Look, Captain, a circuit tech- 
nology as highly developed as 
theirs should be able to crack the 
electronic lock.” 

“I tell you, they were under 
observation all evening!” 

“But were their robots?” 
M’Gamba paused. ‘‘Never 
thought of that.” 

“Well, it seems plausible, 
doesn’t it? Trouble is, this is a 
delicate matter. We can’t just 
arrest them on suspicion; we’ll 
need mighty good proof.” 

M ’GAMBA rubbed his chin. 

“I think a look at this Arc- 
turian’s neck pouch could be ar- 
ranged. He’s down in the shop 
now, working up a demonstra- 



tion model. I’ll have one of my 
skilled operators go down and 
talk to him and — ah — accident- 
ally cut the thongs of the pouch 
with a beam-slicer. Cut the pouch 
itself open, too. The contents will 
spill out and — 

“It’s your problem. Just make 
sure you have a cover-up in case 
he turns out not to be carrying 
the stuff, after all. Call me as 
soon as you know, will you?” 
Welcome clicked off and sat for 
a moody while, considering his 
own next move. Finally he sighed 
and called Christine. “Get hold, 
of Rappapa and have him come 
here, please. Diplomatically, of 
course.” 

“Auch, you don’t think — ” 

“I’m afraid I do.” 

Welcome stuffed his pipe and 
looked out at the savage dawn- 
glare. Damn and blast, how did 
you accuse an accredited envoy 
of theft, especially when you 
liked him? 

Rappapa came bustling in ac- 
companied by no more than a 
midget helicopter. 

“Twice in one arbitrary diurnal 
period?” he quacked. “Believe 
me, your excellency, I am flat- 
tered by such hyper-attention on 
the part of your doubtless busy- 
with - vast - problems - of - interstel - 
lar-negotiations self.” 

“I need your help,” said the 
human awkwardly. “Would you 
like a cigar?” 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Gratitude erupts from me,” 
said Rappapa. “If there is even 
of-the-most-micrometric way I 
can assist in — ” 

“It’s this business of the theft.” 
Welcome drew heavily on his 
pipe. “It puts my whole planet 
in a deucedly bad light. We have 
to catch the burglar to save our 
own reputation. At the same time, 
he is somebody’s diplomat, which 
could lead to an unholy row if 
we arrested him.” 

“Anyone who would ponder the 
violation of your excellency’s so 
lavish hospitality should be de- 
dignified,” said Rappapa indig- 
nantly. 

I T’S not that simple, I’m 
afraid,” Welcome explained. 
“His planet would react with a 
great show of injury, one harsh 
word would lead to another, the 
seeds of mutual suspicion would 
be sown. Don’t you think, Free- 
man Rappapa, it would be best 
for the thief’s own planet, too, if 
he merely surrendered his loot? 
Then no one need ever know what 
has happened. The whole thing 
could be discreetly hushed up 
and forgotten.” 

“First the much -to -be -pon- 
dered question of locating the 
pilferish ambassador arises,” said 
Rappapa. “Does your excellency 
the assistance of my abject self 
in such detection work desire?” 
So he’s going to stall , after all. 



“If the thief confessed,” said 
Welcome desperately, “I would 
understand that he committed 
the act only from the highest 
motives of planetarism. I would 
not look down on him for it, or 
discriminate against him in any 
way.” 

Rappapa waved his cigar rev- 
erently. “Behold the magnanim- 
ity of the magnanimous!” 

“If he doesn’t confess, though, 
if we have to find him for our- 
selves, we may have to be rather 
stern about it afterward.” 

“Of course. Your excellency 
burrows to the very foundation 
of justice.” 

The visor buzzed. Here goes, 
thought Welcome. He clicked it 
on, and M’Gamba’s features 
looked bleakly out at him. 

“Well?” 

“It worked,” said the captain. 
“My agent got his hands on the 
films, shoved them under the 
nearest reader. They’re the ones, 
sure enough.” 

“And how about the — one who 
carried them?” 

“He insists he didn’t know he 
had them. Says someone must 
have planted them on him. That 
wouldn’t be hard to do, of course, 
so I haven’t put him under for- 
mal arrest yet. What do you 
suggest?” 

“I’ll call you back.” Welcome 
clicked off and turned to Rap- 
papa. “Well, we’ve located our 



HORSE TRADER 



153 




thief. Finally,” he said. 

“So I g-gathered.” The Arc- 
turian jittered about on the floor, 
stuttering in his excitement. “Who 
is it? Who is the low, vile, not-to- 
be-mentioned-without-expectora- 
tion creature?” 

“His name,” said Welcome 
heavily, “is Smapopoi.” 

“Sma— ” 

“Yes.” 

“B-but — donnabi whichu krx 
killuwi — it is not of the possible! 
Believe me, excellent excellency, 
w-we are p-pure as distilled 
water!” Rappapa began trem- 
bling. 

“Your people should be able 
to figure out an electronic lock 
and have your robots pick it,” 
said Welcome tonelessly. “And 
Srnapopoi was carrying the 
films.” 

“Copies? Copies m-made by 
the th-thief to divert suspicion!” 

W ELCOME came around 
from behind the desk. 
“Don’t take it so hard,” he said 
kindly. “If you like, we’ll claim 
that Srnapopoi did it on his own 
initiative, without your knowl- 
edge. We’ll hush it all up.” 
“But he couldn’t have !” wailed 
Rappapa. “The robots can only 
my orders obey!” 

Welcome leaned back against 
the desk, scowling. His pipe had 
gone out and he made an elabo- 
rate ritual of relighting it to hide 



his uneasiness. He had given 
Rappapa an out and the duck 
hadn’t taken it. Nor would, you 
expect anyone cool enough to 
pull that job to blow his jets 
this way when discovered— or, for 
that matter, to hide his loot so 
clumsily, though of course there 
was no accounting for non-human 
psychology. 

Rappapa began to cry. “W<e 
are besmirched with accusations 
and have lost confidence. You 
think I am a not-fit-to-wipe-the- 
feet-on-egg-eater. What will my 
nestmates say?” 

“Now, after all—” 

“They will say, ‘Twiutiuk poi- 
poi tu spung Rappapa.’ ” 

Welcome scratched his head 
helplessly. “All right, all right, 
you didn’t do it. You’ve been the 
victim of a fraud. But then who 
is guilty?” 

Rappapa rubbed the tears from 
his bulging eyes. “It is necessary 
to protect the Kwillitchian self 
by the true monster finding,” he 
said with some return of his old 
perkiness. “Will you give me out 
of your polychromatic mercy a 
chance?” 

“Certainly. Because if you’re 
not guiity, then we’ve still got to 
find the one who is.” Welcome 
sat down on a corner of the desk. 
Inwardly, he groaned at the 
thought of starting over again, 
just when he had thought the 
business was settled — but, damn

it, you couldn’t simply call an 
official delegate a liar, however 
much you might want- to. “Let 
us assume that you did not do it. 
That leaves two possibilities, 
Sirius and Vega.” 

“Would you from the scintil- 
lant heights of intellect descend 
to explain the omission of Pro- 
cyon and Alpha Centauri?” 
“Well, the Centaurian is ob- 
vious. He’s too stupid even to 
think of such a job. And Orazuni 
and his people were never out of 
sight of a human last night.” 
Fairness forced Welcome to ad- 
mit: “Neither were you Arcturi- 
ans, for that matter. But you had 
the robots.” 

“Could not Orazuni have had 
hidden-away robots?” 

“Not with his technical back- 
ground. They’re biologists, bio- 
chemists, not electronicians, ex- 
cept on an elementary level. 
Unless Orazuni stole the key, 
which he did not, he just had no 
means of opening that lock.” 
“That leaves only some elabo- 
rate and improbable-on-the-face- 
of-it plot by Sirius or Vega.” 
“And I don’t think it could 
have been Vega. They’re back- 
ward in electronics. With the 
atmospheric pressure of New 
Jupiter, they never even devel- 
oped a vacuum tube. And as for 
Sirius — ” 

“No, wait! Robot delegate sent 
to do foul deeds while the weaver 



of intricate plots sits at his ease 
in public view.” Rappapa’s eyes 
bulged until they seemed in dan- 
ger of falling out. 

Welcome looked at him, and 
he looked at Welcome. 

“Killuweetchunguf” squawked 
Rappapa. “Let us go!” 

“Hold on. We have to think 
this out.” 

“No time to think! Come!” 

R APPAPA bounded from the 
office. Welcome cursed and 
charged after him. If that impul- 
sive featherhead accused the 
wrong being — 

Christine saw four feet of 
squawking Arcturian, followed by 
six feet of cursing human, fol- 
lowed by seven inches of valiant- 
ly laboring helicopter, shoot 
through her office. She got up and 
raced after them. The receptionist 
saw the parade go by and ex- 
citedly joined it. A passing janitor 
saw them streaking through the 
hall and took out after the re- 
ceptionist. 

Rappapa went down the ramp 
to the fourth sub-level, screech- 
ing and whistling. Thevorakz 
came out of his quarters to see 
what the fuss was about, just in 
time for Rappapa to unbalance 
him by darting under his legs, 
Welcome to bowl him over, and 
Christine, the receptionist, the 
janitor, and a few odd specimens 
picked up along the way to

trample across him. As he rose, 
howling his fury, the helicopter 
collided with his head. He snarled 
and galloped after the rest. 

“Where is the Centaurian?” 
clacked Rappapa at George, who 
was rolling down the corridor. 
“Where is he lurking?” 

“In the clubroom,” said the 
Vegan, pointing. 

Rappapa vaulted the metal 
shell. Welcome and Christine 
leapfrogged over him. The others 
drew up, until Thevorakz took a 
dying broad jump above the 



whole group. George stared after 
them, shrugged, and rolled im- 
perturbably on his way. 

The clubroom was almost de- 
serted: a stray Arcturian was 

reading a murder mystery, Hel- 
mung was draped over the bar 
clutching a bottle, and Orazuni 
sat chatting with the warrior. 

“There they are!” yammered 
Rappapa. “There abide the over- 
ly diabolical thieves!” 

“Shut up, you bloody fool — ” 
Welcome tripped on a chair and 
went flat on the floor. When he 



crawled up, Rappapa was grab- 
bing Helmung by the baldric and 
chattering a stream of questions. 

“What is, little one?” rumbled 
the barbarian. “And why?” 

“We want to know how much 
Orazuni offered you to turn 
thief!” 

“I?” Orazuni smiled tolerantly. 
“Our colleague seems a trifle ex- 
cited, Freeman Welcome.” 

T HEVORAKZ clumped up to 
the bar, brushing assorted 
humans aside. 



“I demand an apology!” he 
roared. “I did not come nine 
light-yearth to be walked on!” 
“Let me go,” growled Helmung 
uneasily. He batted Rappapa 
away. 

“Help!” squealed the Arcturian. 
“Com-pan-ee— HELP !” 

“Really, now,” said Orazuni 
reproachfully, “I must say this 
is a most undignified scene.” _ 
“Will you apologize to me?” 
bellowed Thevorakz. 

“I go my place,” said Helmung. 
“Do not follow.” He shoved his 




way through the crowd. 

“Stop, thief!”- yelled Rappapa. 
His robots marched ia the door. 
“The Centaurian!” he added. 

“Now, see here — ” began Ora- 
zuni. 

“Stop him, too!” cried Rap- 
papa. “He the films has!” 

“I shall also demand an apol- 
ogy,” said the Procyonite with 
stiff dignity. 

Thevorakz reached out and 
gathered in a handful of his cloak. 
“Maybe you better wait a little,” 
he said. 

Helmung had just noticed the 
robots deploying before him. 

“I see little men!” he gasped. 
He waved his arms and started an 
incantation. 

A detachment of robots 
swarmed up some curtains, took 
them down, and began to hobble 
the Centaurian with them. Hel- 
mung looked suddenly crushed. 

"My witchcraft not works here 
on Luna,” he mumbled. “I want 
go home.” 

Welcome decided it was time 
for him to do something. 

“Helmung,” he asked, “did you 
open the door to the Sirian quar- 
ters for Orazuni?” 

“I promise him I not tell any- 
one that,” said Helmung in a 
self-righteous voice. “You torture 
me, do anything, I not confess I 
was one who open door.” 

Suddenly Orazuni broke into a 
laugh. 



“Never mind,” he said. “Here 
is the other copy of the book.” 
He fished in his portfolio and 
tossed a packet over to Welcome. 
“And now, freemen, if you will 
excuse me — ” 

Thevorakz’s bellow cut through 
a sudden quiet. “When do 1 get 
my apology?” 

“TT should have been obvious, 
I suppose,” said Welcome to 
Christine and M’Gamba. “That 
attempt to frame the Afcturians 
by making an extra copy of the 
book and planting it on one of 
them couldn’t have thrown us off 
very long. But Orazuni only 
needed to have us baying along 
his false trail for a few days; then 
he'd be safely on his way home, 
bearing the films. We did know, 
though, that he had been culti- 
vating Helmung’s friendship ever 
since he learned that the Cen- 
taurians are telekinetic. His in- 
terest was scientific to start with, 
but it soon occurred to him that 
if Helmung could control electron 
streams easily enough to make 
pictures on an oscilloscope, he 
could surely open an electronic 
lock. And the Vegan data is valu- 
able.” 

“Did he hope to get more out 
of it than just the tables them- 
selves?” asked M’Gamba. 

“Yes. I was talking to him just 
now, and he was quite frank and 
cheerful. Procyon has entertained

notions of taking the job of Horse 
Trading — ultimately the scien- 
tific leadership in all respects — - 
away from Earth. This theft 
would not only have discredited 
us, but given them a nice chunk 
of* knowledge to trade with, be- 
sides what they learned from us 
through legitimate channels. Ora- 
zuni got Helmung to steal the 
book from him by the bribe of a 
love potion-#A hormone mixture 
adapted to Centaurian biochem- 
istry. Helmung’s received that 
payment, by the way, and is 
eager to get home and try it out; 
so that’s one more nuisance off 
our necks.” 

“And what are we going to do 
about Orazuni?” asked Christine 
worriedly. 

Welcome shrugged. “Keep an 
eye on him. What else can we do? 
We need the knowledge and the 
good will of his planet. We’ll go 



on just as if nothing had hap- 
pened. Horse Traders can’t be 
very prim, you know.” 

H E looked out the office win- 
dow. The Sun was visible 
now, its blinding glare filtered to 
a soft radiance, and the sterile 
land of crags and craters had an 
eerie beauty over it. 

“Hard to believe this affair 
only took one working day,” he 
said. “And what a day! Can we 
have some nice peaceful routine 
for a while, Chris?” 

“Not for long,” she told him. 
“The Quest is due in from Tau 
Ceti soon. The previous expedi- 
tion there reported the natives 
were quite anxious to learn from 
us and readying a delegation. I 
think their proudest achievement 
to date is an ingenious method of 
chipping flint.”

CVERY important discovery relating 
*— 1 ' to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and cflect, as applied to self- 
advancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written :d> *ut the wise 
men of old. A popular f.< ' < y has it that 
their secrets of personal power at ! uc- 
cessful living were lost to the i Id. 
Knowledge of nature's la 1 .1 dat- 
ed through the ages, is never f t At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty general i mi. .igo, less 
than l/100th of V'/c id the ruth"* 
people were thought cap.il-jf of i . riv- 
ing basic knowh d ■' ihuut the laws of 
life, for it is an . ntary truism that 
knowledge is p« r and that power 
cannot be entru ird to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; mu recognised when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which “whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak- 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleep- 
ing. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of self- 
understanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world’s 
oldest institutions, first known in Amer- 
ica in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosi- 
crucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the "Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the ini- 
tials “AMORC." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a com- 
mercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, "The Mastery of Life.” 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe

PEBBLE 
m THE SKY 

by Isaac /Ysimov 

It began when Joseph Schwartz was walking down a street in 
Chicago, past the Institute tor Nuclear Research. He raised one 
foot in the twentieth century; he lowered it in Galactic Era 827, 
the victim of an odd accident inside the Institute involving an 
experiment with crude uranium. 

Schwartz awoke to a strange world — he was still on Earth, but 
at a time when all the planets of the Galaxy were inhabited, and 
the people of Earth were outcasts, suffering vindictive discrimina- 
tion because their tiny world was radioactive! 

His subsequent adventures involved Schwartz in a brewing 
revolution of the Earth militarists, and a romance between the 
daughter of an eminent Earth scientist and a young Galactic 
archeologist. Then, strangely, it was the little retired tailor from 
Chicago who found himself the only man who could avert the im- 
pending cosmic disaster. But Schwartz, homesick and confused, 
wasn't sure he even cared! 

Combining tenseness, irony, romance, and fast action with a 
basis of really intriguing science, Pebble in the Sky is a truly 
ingenious tale of the far-distant future.
